Bazaar 1.3 has been released.

Where to get Bazaar ?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The Bazaar homepage at http://bazaar.canonical.com/ lists binary and
source locations for bazaar.

Key user visible changes:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
* Revision building optimised, will now prefer full tree copies to=20
  very-distant revlib copies, preventing certain (common) pathological
  behaviours.
* update, status, diff, commit have been moderately performance tuned.
  This has (for instance) reduce the time for update to 25% of its
  pre-tuning times.
* inode signatures now provide id shortcuts for explicit ids (previously
  only names and tagline ids where tuned).
* many commands now take tree-context by default. i.e. whereis-archive
  will use the project tree archive by default
* url support - most commands directly support urls. i.e. build-config
  http://server/a-file-with-a-config/
* -A has been deprecated across the board -=20
  foo@example.com[/category... ] is supported consistently.
* An annotate command has been implemented, that can annotate some or
  all of the files in a tree, along a single line of development.
  Supporting changes from merges is a planned future feature.
* integrated gpg support via gpgme - zero setup for most signed archive
  usage.
* debian version numbers are supported in the version component of
  branch names. This will work with baz and tla archives - but tla will
  silently ignore them.
* 'id' and 'inventory' with 'names tagging' now return the same ids that
  are created and used in changesets.
* introduced debug() tool internally - controllable via ARCH_DEBUG_LOG
  and ARCH_DEBUG_OPTIONS to log internal progress to a file - useful for
  debugging without rebuilding.
* Consolidated archive registration system (the ArchiveRegistration spec
  from the wiki) removes the need for -MIRROR / -MIRROR2 etc pseudo
  aliases, and allows archive-mirror --all-mirrors which will mirror to
  multiple locations at once.
* 'upgrade' command which will migrate configuration details as they
  evolve. This allows incremental improvements in client configuration
  without user pain. Currently this upgrades the archive registry to the
  new format.
* 'change-archive' command which will have all archive-specific change
  functionality built in to it. Currently this allows enabling, or
  removing GPG signatures from archives.
* improved sftp user input parsing - usernames may contain @ symbols.
* diff -p support. This doesn't affect the archive format.

Bugfixes (over baz 1.2):
* revlib paths with spaces are now supported.
* minor performance improvement for baz format archives - one roundtrip
  only to determine the entire set of branches available in the archive.
* baz status on unimported trees now provides useful feedback, although
  it doesn't provide full functionality.

Community patches:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Baz incorporates many patches for the libarch codebase that it is based
on from the community. Thank you to the coders of those patches ...=20

Documentation:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
New documentation for baz 1.3 is available in the bazaar-docs category,
though prebuilt packages are not yet available.

Archive-registry and GPG configuration upgrade
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
This is one of the big long term UI goals of bazaar. It elminates the
use of 'registered names' throughout the baz codebase, except where they
are required to provide a smooth upgrade path. You can no longer trigger
esoteric bugs by doing a 'library-add' of 'foo-SOURCE/c--b--v' - the
code will do the right thing. A corollary to this is that urls are
directly supported by the user interface for most commands. I.e.
archive-fixup will accept the url of an archive. A side effect of this
is that 'write-through' mirrors are now possible. Just register the
master archive with a lower priority than your local mirror, and baz
will get from the local mirror but commit to master.

One of the enablers for this is the elimination of the signing scripts
that depended on registered names (and were thus quite fragile and
inflexible). We've implemented in-baz signature verification using a new
dependency - libgpgme - which allows baz direct control over gpg (or
s/mime if someone wants to send in a patch) signature verification.=20

This code is backwards compatible code. The current setup of baz on
your machines will operate as-is (and if it doesn't, its a bug, not a
feature).

A number of commands that needed=20
$baz command -A archive something-here
now operate with=20
$baz command archive/something-here

If you have problems, your old configuration files are stored in
~/.arch-params/upgraded-by-baz-1.3 and can be restored to get back your
previous config.

Thats it. You can now use urls in most commands, and mirroring and
publishing of archives should have become a lot simpler.

Archives are now registered in ~/.arch-params/archives/$OFFICIAL_NAME.
The ~/.arch-params/=3Dlocations directory is deprecated and baz plans to
remove support for it (other than upgrades) in baz 1.4. The new system
allows us to remove the -SOURCE and -MIRROR concepts from baz by
recording multiple archive locations under the official name. One
immediately visible benefit is that archive-mirror will now do the right
thing with signed archives automatically.

What do you need to do to upgrade to this code?
$ baz upgrade --leave-old-config will preserve the old config files.
This is not recommended, as you will then have two sets of diverging
configurations.
$ baz upgrade --move-old-config will move the =3Dlocations registry files
it upgrades into ~/.arch-params/upgraded-by-baz-1.3. This is
recommended, but means that tla, and older versions of baz, will no
longer know about your archives. (You can just move the files back if
you need to downgrade).

When baz upgrade looks at signing and checking scripts, it makes a best
effort attempt to extract information from them, if it fails it emits a
warning - you should review the SigningRules and ArchiveRegistration
pages and tell baz what policy you actually want.

I expect this to be the last point release in the 1.3 series. Sorry for=20
the regressions - test cases have been added though.


Bazaar 1.3.2 has been released.=20

This point release corrects two performance regressions from baz 1.2, and a
a major correctness regression in 'update'.
* update was using the wrong reference inode sig resulting changes not bein=
g=20
  applied
* ancestry gathering was too greedy leading to status or diff taking ages.
* get would scan entire versions even when not necessary.


Bazaar 1.3.1 has been released.

This point release fixes a regression with =3Ddont-care tagged files. The
remainder of this document is the release notes for 1.3.


Where to get Bazaar ?

The Bazaar homepage at http://bazaar.canonical.com/ lists binary and
source locations for bazaar.

Key user visible changes:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
* Revision building optimised, will now prefer full tree copies to=20
  very-distant revlib copies, preventing certain (common) pathological
  behaviours.
* update, status, diff, commit have been moderately performance tuned.
  This has (for instance) reduce the time for update to 25% of its
  pre-tuning times.
* inode signatures now provide id shortcuts for explicit ids (previously
  only names and tagline ids where tuned).
* many commands now take tree-context by default. i.e. whereis-archive
  will use the project tree archive by default
* url support - most commands directly support urls. i.e. build-config
  http://server/a-file-with-a-config/
* -A has been deprecated across the board -=20
  foo@example.com[/category... ] is supported consistently.
* An annotate command has been implemented, that can annotate some or
  all of the files in a tree, along a single line of development.
  Supporting changes from merges is a planned future feature.
* integrated gpg support via gpgme - zero setup for most signed archive
  usage.
* debian version numbers are supported in the version component of
  branch names. This will work with baz and tla archives - but tla will
  silently ignore them.
* 'id' and 'inventory' with 'names tagging' now return the same ids that
  are created and used in changesets.
* introduced debug() tool internally - controllable via ARCH_DEBUG_LOG
  and ARCH_DEBUG_OPTIONS to log internal progress to a file - useful for
  debugging without rebuilding.
* Consolidated archive registration system (the ArchiveRegistration spec
  from the wiki) removes the need for -MIRROR / -MIRROR2 etc pseudo
  aliases, and allows archive-mirror --all-mirrors which will mirror to
  multiple locations at once.
* 'upgrade' command which will migrate configuration details as they
  evolve. This allows incremental improvements in client configuration
  without user pain. Currently this upgrades the archive registry to the
  new format.
* 'change-archive' command which will have all archive-specific change
  functionality built in to it. Currently this allows enabling, or
  removing GPG signatures from archives.
* improved sftp user input parsing - usernames may contain @ symbols.
* diff -p support. This doesn't affect the archive format.

Bugfixes (over baz 1.2):
* revlib paths with spaces are now supported.
* minor performance improvement for baz format archives - one roundtrip
  only to determine the entire set of branches available in the archive.
* baz status on unimported trees now provides useful feedback, although
  it doesn't provide full functionality.

Documentation:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
New documentation for baz 1.3 is available in the bazaar-docs category,
though prebuilt packages are not yet available.

Archive-registry and GPG configuration upgrade
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

This is one of the big long term UI goals of bazaar. It elminates the
use of 'registered names' throughout the baz codebase, except where they
are required to provide a smooth upgrade path. You can no longer trigger
esoteric bugs by doing a 'library-add' of 'foo-SOURCE/c--b--v' - the
code will do the right thing. A corollary to this is that urls are
directly supported by the user interface for most commands. I.e.
archive-fixup will accept the url of an archive. A side effect of this
is that 'write-through' mirrors are now possible. Just register the
master archive with a lower priority than your local mirror, and baz
will get from the local mirror but commit to master.

One of the enablers for this is the elimination of the signing scripts
that depended on registered names (and were thus quite fragile and
inflexible). We've implemented in-baz signature verification using a new
dependency - libgpgme - which allows baz direct control over gpg (or
s/mime if someone wants to send in a patch) signature verification.=20

This code is backwards compatible code. The current setup of baz on
your machines will operate as-is (and if it doesn't, its a bug, not a
feature).

A number of commands that needed=20
$baz command -A archive something-here
now operate with=20
$baz command archive/something-here

If you have problems, your old configuration files are stored in
~/.arch-params/upgraded-by-baz-1.3 and can be restored to get back your
previous config.

Thats it. You can now use urls in most commands, and mirroring and
publishing of archives should have become a lot simpler.

Archives are now registered in ~/.arch-params/archives/$OFFICIAL_NAME.
The ~/.arch-params/=3Dlocations directory is deprecated and baz plans to
remove support for it (other than upgrades) in baz 1.4. The new system
allows us to remove the -SOURCE and -MIRROR concepts from baz by
recording multiple archive locations under the official name. One
immediately visible benefit is that archive-mirror will now do the right
thing with signed archives automatically.

What do you need to do to upgrade to this code?
$ baz upgrade --leave-old-config will preserve the old config files.
This is not recommended, as you will then have two sets of diverging
configurations.
$ baz upgrade --move-old-config will move the =3Dlocations registry files
it upgrades into ~/.arch-params/upgraded-by-baz-1.3. This is
recommended, but means that tla, and older versions of baz, will no
longer know about your archives. (You can just move the files back if
you need to downgrade).

When baz upgrade looks at signing and checking scripts, it makes a best
effort attempt to extract information from them, if it fails it emits a
warning - you should review the SigningRules and ArchiveRegistration
pages and tell baz what policy you actually want.

PQM now has basic support for bzr in parallel with baz/tla/arx. You can
get this from the usual archive:

http://people.ubuntu.com/~robertc/robert.collins@canonical.com--general/arc=
h-pqm--main--0

Installing this version requires bzr and bzrtools to probe for bzr
branches. There is a config-manager config in the root called
'pqm.config' - if you build that it will put the required code in the
right places.

Using bzr with pqm is straight forward:
 * Create a [URL] section for the branch. This can be a prefix
    i.e. [file:///home/archives/foo/]
    or an actual branch:
    i.e. [file:///home/archives/foo/mainline]

Then just submit merges as usual; replacing arch names with URL's in the
merge request.

Work to be done on the bzr support includes published_at:
=3D=3D=3D=3D
  A common setup with arch is to refer to things by name. This=20
  allows for users on local systems - say nfs - to see a copy of the
  branch without having any access to the actual mainline - just like a
  maintainer with bzr operates. (The local branch on the maintainers
  machine is their private copy, the one they push to their website is
  the published copy).

  To do this with pqm, setup a branch with a published_at url.
  [file:///home/pqm/archives/foo/]
  published_at=3Dfile:///home/archives/foo/

  Here pqm will treat requests for
  file:///home/pqm/archives/foo/mainline and
  file:///home/archives/foo/mainline identically
=3D=3D=3D=3D

and direct patch application etc.

If folk use this, or want to contribute ... the more the merrier.

Subject: Bazaar Roadmap


=3D=3D Bazaar Project Roadmap =3D=3D
=3D=3D Bazaar =3D=3D
The Bazaar-NG project has demonstrated its superior ease of use and
performance over Bazaar 1. While Bazaar-NG was being sketched out
and tested we had decided to defer the decision about which code base
would become Bazaar 2. The Bazaar-NG codebase offers a number of
advantages over the Bazaar 1 codebase:

 * Bazaar-NG is implemented in python.
 * Bazaar's simpler design has resulted in simpler code.

Accordingly Bazaar-NG will become Bazaar version 2 when it reaches
'production readiness'. We expect to releae Bazaar 2 in the first
quarter of 2006

Canonical will continue to support Bazaar during the Bazaar-NG
development process. Future releases of Bazaar after 1.5 will contain fixes
(such as security) but generally will not contain improvements.  Bazaar 1
will have one or two more releases sponsored by Canonical. This will bring
the project to a stable position to finish Bazaar-NG and give us time to
test conversion logic from Bazaar 1 to Bazaar-NG.

Readers are encouraged to read more about Bazaar-NG at
http://bazaar.canonical.com/Bzr


=3D=3D The Super Mirror =3D=3D
Canonical sponsors mirrors.sourcecontrol.net. mirrors.sourcecontrol.net
provides public copies of Bazaar and GNU Arch branches for anyone that
wants their projects available but either lacks their own webserver or
does not have enough bandwidth to host their branches for public access.

The supermirror will be upgraded in the next few months to support
Bazaar-NG branches so that, when Bazaar 2 is released, everything needed
to work with it as one works with Bazaar will be available.

I'm happy to announce the release of bazaar-ng 0.0.7, which features
major improvements over the previous release.

We have improved the test coverage and the ease of using the test
framework in this release.  If contributing new features, please write
tests for them.

Thankyou to everyone who sent comments or patches; those that were not
integrated this time will be handled in the future.

I'd also like to welcome some more Canonical employees as contributors
to bazaar-ng, particularly Robert Collins,  James Blackwell, and David
Allouche.



bzr-0.0.7 2005-09-02

  NEW FEATURES:

    * ``bzr shell-complete`` command contributed by Clint Adams to
      help with intelligent shell completion.

    * New expert command ``bzr find-merge-base`` for debugging merges.


  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Much better merge support.

    * merge3 conflicts are now reported with markers like '<<<<<<<'
      (seven characters) which is the same as CVS and pleases things
      like emacs smerge.


  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr upgrade`` no longer fails when trying to fix trees that
      mention revisions that are not present.

    * Fixed bugs in listing plugins from ``bzr plugins``.

    * Fix case of $EDITOR containing options for the editor.

    * Fix log -r refusing to show the last revision.
      (Patch from Goffredo Baroncelli.)


  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr log --show-ids`` shows the revision ids of all parents.

    * Externally provided commands on your $BZRPATH no longer need
      to recognize --bzr-usage to work properly, and can just handle
      --help themselves.


  LIBRARY:

    * Changed trace messages to go through the standard logging
      framework, so that they can more easily be redirected by
      libraries.

Somehow I doubt that the gpg signature had a virus. I'm thinking 
someone's mailscanner needs to be updated, so that "the main body of 
virus data" is up-to-date, and stops flagging things.

Otherwise, I think you are announcing that 0.1rc1 is available 
somewhere, could you resend the location of where to get it?

If you want to get the new bzr.dev, your best option is rsync.

The new bzr.dev in the new format:
bazaar-ng.org::bazaar-ng/bzr/bzr.dev

The new bzr.dev the old format
bazaar-ng.org::bazaar-ng/bzr/bzr.dev.format4


I've tried bzr upgrade, bzr pull, and I get this:

Bazaar-NG version 0.1rc1 is now available. This is the migration point
to weaves - to the format-5 branch. Assuming no critical bugs are found,
we plan to release this on Friday evening, or Monday.

The http://www.bazaar-ng.org/bzr/bzr.dev branch has been converted to a
format-5 branch. A copy of the same branch in format-4 format to ease
upgrades is available at http://www.bazaar-ng.org/bzr/bzr.dev.format4
The old branch is available at http://www.bazaar-ng.org/bzr/bzr.dev.old.

Thanks to all the community contributors - the NEWS file follows.

Cheers,
Rob (pseudo Martin for today)

bzr 0.1 2005-10-06


  BUG FIXES:

    * bzr-man.py has been updated to work again. Contributed by
      Rob Weir.

    * Locking is now done with fcntl.lockf which works with NFS
      file systems. Contributed by Harald Meland.

    * Commit will no longer commit without a log message, an
      error is returned instead. Contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

    * If you commit a specific file in a sub directory, any of its
      parent directories that are added but not listed will be
      automatically included. Suggested by Michael Ellerman.


  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * 'branch' now accepts a --basis parameter which will take advantage
      of local history when making a new branch. This allows faster
      branching of remote branches. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
      Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using
      'bzr upgrade'.

    * Symlinks are now versionable. Initial patch by
      Erik Toubro Nielsen, updated to head by Robert Collins.

    * Executable bits are tracked on files. Patch from Gustavo
      Niemeyer.

    * 'bzr status' now shows unknown files inside a selected directory.
      Patch from Heikki Paajanen.

    * Merge conflicts are recorded in .bzr. Two new commands 'conflicts'
      and 'resolve' have needed added, which list and remove those
      merge conflicts respectively. A conflicted tree cannot be
committed
      in. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.


  INTERNALS:

    * Test case failures have the exception printed after the log
      for your viewing pleasure.

    * InventoryEntry is now an abstract base class, use one of the
      concrete InventoryDirectory etc classes instead.


  TESTING:

    * Removed testsweet module so that tests can be run after
      bzr installed by 'bzr selftest'.

    * 'bzr selftest' command-line arguments can now be partial ids
      of tests to run, e.g. 'bzr selftest test_weave'

Some of the bazaar developers will be at the Ubuntu Below Zero
conference in Montreal at the end of this month.  We'd be delighted to
meet any bzr hackers or users who are in the area.  There's a page
about the bazaar side of the conference here:

  http://bazaar.canonical.com/UbuntuBelowZero


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Canonical is proud to announce the third Ubuntu conference! Most
people who made it to Sydney and Matar=F2 can vouch for the fact that it
was an intense, productive and fun experience for everyone.

Here are the things you need to know:

 --> What: Ubuntu Below Zero
 --> Where: Montreal, Canada
 --> When: 30 Oct - 10 Nov 2005 (important schedule details on the wiki)
 --> Who: Open to the Public

Trying to organize an even better event, the conference will be
structured a little differently this time and will be broken down like
this:

        OCT30 -> Ubuntu Love Day (Interesting to Everyone)
  OCT31-NOV05 -> Ubuntu/Launchpad Developer Summit (Interesting
                 Primarily to Ubuntu and Launchpad Developers)
  NOV07-NOV10 -> Launchpad Development Summit Cont'd (Interesting
                 Primarily to Launchpad Hackers)

Folks from the community should definitely come on October 30th. The
rest of the conference is going to be focused around developers
brainstorming and writing specifications.

While all are welcome at all points, everyone should expect to
contribute in a hands on manner to the technical direction of Ubuntu
and Launchpad if you're there after Love Day. Also, we would
appreciate being told in advance if you will attend. There is
information at the link below on how to do this.

While there's not a huge amount of information online, everything we
do have is here or linked from this wiki page:

  http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBelowZero

As we get more information, we will be updating that page.

Like the previous conferences, there is a limited amount of money for
sponsorship. Anyone is welcome to apply for sponsorship although we
will give preference to people who are active, visible, and known in
the community and who are from the general geographical area. Our
conferences move around globally so it's folks in the Americas that
will get precedent this time. More information on sponsorship linked
from the conference page. All requests for sponsorship must be made no
later than September 11th.

Any specific questions not answered on that page can be directed to
info@ubuntu.com.

Regards,
Mako

I'm happy to announce the release of bazaar-ng 0.1.  Thankyou very
much to everyone who has contributed patches, suggestions, or bug
reports.

http://bazaar-ng.org/pkg/bzr-0.1.tar.gz

Changes in this release:

bzr 0.1 2005-10-11

  NOTES:

    * 'bzr branch' over http initially gives a very high estimate
      of completion time but it should fall as the first few
      revisions are pulled in.  branch is still slow on
      high-latency connections.

  BUG FIXES:

    * bzr-man.py has been updated to work again. Contributed by
      Rob Weir.

    * Locking is now done with fcntl.lockf which works with NFS
      file systems. Contributed by Harald Meland.

    * When a merge encounters a file that has been deleted on
      one side and modified on the other, the old contents are
      written out to foo.BASE and foo.SIDE, where SIDE is this
      or OTHER. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * Export was choosing incorrect file paths for the content of
      the tarball, this has been fixed by Aaron Bentley.

    * Commit will no longer commit without a log message, an
      error is returned instead. Contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.

    * If you commit a specific file in a sub directory, any of its
      parent directories that are added but not listed will be
      automatically included. Suggested by Michael Ellerman.

    * bzr commit and upgrade did not correctly record new revisions
      for files with only a change to their executable status.
      bzr will correct this when it encounters it. Fixed by
      Robert Collins

    * HTTP tests now force off the use of http_proxy for the duration.
      Contributed by Gustavo Niemeyer.

    * Fix problems in merging weave-based branches that have
      different partial views of history.

    * Symlink support: working with symlinks when not in the root of a
      bzr tree was broken, patch from Scott James Remnant.


  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * 'branch' now accepts a --basis parameter which will take advantage
      of local history when making a new branch. This allows faster
      branching of remote branches. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * New tree format based on weave files, called version 5.
      Existing branches can be upgraded to this format using
      'bzr upgrade'.

    * Symlinks are now versionable. Initial patch by
      Erik Toubro Nielsen, updated to head by Robert Collins.

    * Executable bits are tracked on files. Patch from Gustavo
      Niemeyer.

    * 'bzr status' now shows unknown files inside a selected directory.
      Patch from Heikki Paajanen.

    * Merge conflicts are recorded in .bzr. Two new commands 'conflicts'
      and 'resolve' have needed added, which list and remove those
      merge conflicts respectively. A conflicted tree cannot be committed
      in. Contributed by Aaron Bentley.

    * 'rm' is now an alias for 'remove'.

    * Stores now split out their content in a single byte prefixed hash,
      dropping the density of files per directory by 256. Contributed by
      Gustavo Niemeyer.

    * 'bzr diff -r branch:URL' will now perform a diff between two branches=
.
      Contributed by Robert Collins.

    * 'bzr log' with the default formatter will show merged revisions,
      indented to the right. Initial implementation contributed by Gustavo
      Niemeyer, made incremental by Robert Collins.


  INTERNALS:

    * Test case failures have the exception printed after the log
      for your viewing pleasure.

    * InventoryEntry is now an abstract base class, use one of the
      concrete InventoryDirectory etc classes instead.

    * Branch raises an UnsupportedFormatError when it detects a
      bzr branch it cannot understand. This allows for precise
      handling of such circumstances.


  TESTING:

    * Removed testsweet module so that tests can be run after
      bzr installed by 'bzr selftest'.

    * 'bzr selftest' command-line arguments can now be partial ids
      of tests to run, e.g. 'bzr selftest test_weave'

I'm happy to announce availability of a release candidate for bzr 0.7.

  http://bazaar.canonical.com/DownloadBzr

Please test this and report any issues; if there are no major problems
this will be the 0.7 release later this week.=20

(This doesn't mean any bugs or patches that have been sent but not yet
merged won't be in the next release.)

A couple of people have suggested that we move towards time-based
releases for bzr.  I propose to start making releases candidates on
around the first of each month.

I'm happy to announce the release of bazaar-ng 0.7, with many new
features and improvements.  Thankyou to everyone who contributed
suggestions, bug reports or patches.

It can be downloaded from http://bazaar.canonical.com/DownloadBzr

A summary of changes since 0.6 follows:

bzr 0.7 2006-01-23

  CHANGES:

    * .bzrignore is excluded from exports, on the grounds that it's a bzr=
=20
      internal-use file and may not be wanted.  (Jamie Wilkinson)

    * The "bzr directories" command were removed in favor of the new
      --kind option to the "bzr inventory" command.  To list all=20
      versioned directories, now use "bzr inventory --kind directory". =20
      (Johan Rydberg)

    * Under Windows configuration directory is now %APPDATA%\bazaar\2.0
      by default. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The parent of Bzr configuration directory can be set by BZR_HOME
      environment variable. Now the path for it is searched in BZR_HOME, th=
en
      in HOME. Under Windows the order is: BZR_HOME, APPDATA (usually
      points to C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Application Data), HOME.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Plugins with the same name in different directories in the bzr plugin
      path are no longer loaded: only the first successfully loaded one is
      used. (Robert Collins)

    * Use systems' external ssh command to open connections if possible. =
=20
      This gives better integration with user settings such as ProxyCommand.
      (James Henstridge)

    * Sftp paths can now be relative, or local, according to the IETF=20
      draft spec.  Paths now take the form:
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/relative/path
      or
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/%2Fabsolute/path
      or
      sftp://user:pass@host:port//absolute/path

    * Permissions on files underneath .bzr/ are inherited from the .bzr=20
      directory. So for a shared repository, simply doing 'chmod -R g+w .bz=
r/'
      will mean that future file will be created with group write permissio=
ns.

    * configure.in and config.guess are no longer in the builtin default=20
      ignore list.

    * '.sw[nop]' pattern ignored, to ignore vim swap files for nameless
      files.  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * "bzr INIT dir" now initializes the specified directory, and creates=
=20
      it if it does not exist.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New remerge command (Aaron Bentley)

    * Better zsh completion script.  (Steve Borho)

    * 'bzr diff' now returns 1 when there are changes in the working=20
      tree. (Robert Collins)

    * 'bzr push' now exists and can push changes to a remote location.=20
      This uses the transport infrastructure, and can store the remote
      location in the ~/.bazaar/branches.conf configuration file.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Test directories are only kept if the test fails and the user requests
      that they be kept.

    * Tweaks to short log printing

    * Added branch nicks, new nick command, printing them in log output.=20
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * If $BZR_PDB is set, pop into the debugger when an uncaught exception=
=20
      occurs.  (Martin Pool)

    * Accept 'bzr resolved' (an alias for 'bzr resolve'), as this is
      the same as Subversion.  (Martin Pool)

    * New ftp transport support (on ftplib), for ftp:// and aftp://=20
      URLs.  (Daniel Silverstone)

    * Commit editor temporary files now start with 'bzr_log.', to allow=20
      text editors to match the file name and set up appropriate modes or=
=20
      settings.  (Magnus Therning)

    * Improved performance when integrating changes from a remote weave. =
=20
      (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * Sftp will attempt to cache the connection, so it is more likely that
      a connection will be reused, rather than requiring multiple password
      requests.

    * bzr revno now takes an optional argument indicating the branch whose
      revno should be printed.  (Michael Ellerman)

    * bzr cat defaults to printing the last version of the file. =20
      (#3632, Matthieu Moy)

    * New global option 'bzr --lsprof COMMAND' runs bzr under the lsprof=20
      profiler.  (Denys Duchier)

    * Faster commits by reading only the headers of affected weave files.=
=20
      (Denys Duchier)

    * 'bzr add' now takes a --dry-run parameter which shows you what would =
be
      added, but doesn't actually add anything. (Michael Ellerman)

    * bzr add now lists how many files were ignored per glob.  add --verbose
      lists the specific files.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Reduced CPU usage for merge/fetch. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * Faster diff and status commands.  (Denys Duchier)

  BUG FIXES:

    * SFTP can walk up to the root path without index errors. (Robert Colli=
ns)

    * Fix bugs in running bzr with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

    * Error when run with -OO

    * Fix bug in reporting http errors that don't have an http error code.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Handle more cases of pipe errors in display commands

    * Change status to 3 for all errors

    * Files that are added and unlinked before committing are completely
      ignored by diff and status

    * Stores with some compressed texts and some uncompressed texts are now
      able to be used. (John A Meinel)

    * Fix for bzr pull failing sometimes under windows

    * Fix for sftp transport under windows when using interactive auth

    * Show files which are both renamed and modified as such in 'bzr=20
      status' output.  (#4503, Daniel Silverstone)

    * Make annotate cope better with revisions committed without a valid=20
      email address.  (Marien Zwart)

    * Fix representation of tab characters in commit messages.  (Harald=20
      Meland)

    * List of plugin directories in BZR_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable is
      now parsed properly under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Show number of revisions pushed/pulled/merged. (Robey Pointer)

    * Keep a cached copy of the basis inventory to speed up operations=20
      that need to refer to it.  (Johan Rydberg, Martin Pool)

      Pool)

    * Remove Makefile.in from default ignore list.  (#6413, Tollef Fog=20
      Heen, Martin Pool)

    * Fix failure in 'bzr added'.  (Nathan McCallum, Martin Pool)

  TESTING:

    * Fix selftest asking for passwords when there are no SFTP keys. =20
      (Robey Pointer, Jelmer Vernooij)=20

    * Fix selftest run with 'python -O'.  (Martin Pool)

    * Fix HTTP tests under Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Make tests work even if HOME is not set (Aaron Bentley)

    * Updated build_tree to use fixed line-endings for tests which read=20
      the file cotents and compare. Make some tests use this to pass under
      Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Skip stat and symlink tests under Windows. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Delay in selftest/testhashcash is now issued under win32 and Cygwin.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Use terminal width to align verbose test output.  (Martin Pool)

    * Blackbox tests are maintained within the bzrlib.tests.blackbox direct=
ory.
      If adding a new test script please add that to
      bzrlib.tests.blackbox.__init__. (Robert Collins)

    * Much better error message if one of the test suites can't be=20
      imported.  (Martin Pool)

    * Make check now runs the test suite twice - once with the default loca=
le,
      and once with all locales forced to C, to expose bugs. This is not=20
      trivially done within python, so for now its only triggered by running
      Make check. Integrators and packagers who wish to check for full=20
      platform support should run 'make check' to test the source.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Tests can now run TestSkipped if they can't execute for any reason.
      (Martin Pool) (NB: TestSkipped should only be raised for correctable
      reasons - see the wiki spec ImprovingBzrTestSuite).

  INTERNALS:

    * WorkingTree.pull has been split across Branch and WorkingTree,
      to allow Branch only pulls. (Robert Collins)

    * commands.display_command now returns the result of the decorated=20
      function. (Robert Collins)

    * LocationConfig now has a set_user_option(key, value) call to save
      a setting in its matching location section (a new one is created
      if needed). (Robert Collins)

    * Branch has two new methods, get_push_location and set_push_location
      to respectively, get and set the push location. (Robert Collins)

    * commands.register_command now takes an optional flag to signal that
      the registrant is planning to decorate an existing command. When=20
      given multiple plugins registering a command is not an error, and
      the original command class (whether built in or a plugin based one) is
      returned to the caller. There is a new error 'MustUseDecorated' for
      signalling when a wrapping command should switch to the original
      version. (Robert Collins)

    * Some option parsing errors will raise 'BzrOptionError', allowing=20
      granular detection for decorating commands. (Robert Collins).

    * Branch.read_working_inventory has moved to
      WorkingTree.read_working_inventory. This necessitated changes to
      Branch.get_root_id, and a move of Branch.set_inventory to WorkingTree
      as well. To make it clear that a WorkingTree cannot always be obtained
      Branch.working_tree() will raise 'errors.NoWorkingTree' if one cannot
      be obtained. (Robert Collins)

    * All pending merges operations from Branch are now on WorkingTree.
      (Robert Collins)

    * The follow operations from Branch have moved to WorkingTree:
      add()
      commit()
      move()
      rename_one()
      unknowns()
      (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.add.smart_add_branch is now smart_add_tree. (Robert Collins)

    * New "rio" serialization format, similar to rfc-822. (Martin Pool)

    * Rename selftests to `bzrlib.tests.test_foo`.  (John A Meinel, Martin=
=20
      Pool)

    * bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins has been changed from an attribute to a=20
      query method. (Robert Collins)
=20
    * New options to read only the table-of-contents of a weave. =20
      (Denys Duchier)

    * Raise NoSuchFile when someone tries to add a non-existant file.
      (Michael Ellerman)

    * Simplify handling of DivergedBranches in cmd_pull().
      (Michael Ellerman)
		  =20
    * Deprecated functions and methods can now be marked as such using the=
=20
      bzrlib.symbol_versioning module. Marked method have their docstring
      updated and will issue a DeprecationWarning using the warnings module
      when they are used. (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.osutils.safe_unicode now exists to provide parameter coercion
      for functions that need unicode strings. (Robert Collins)

I'm happy to announce Bazaar-NG release candidate bzr0.8rc1, now
available from:

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/OfficialDownloads

We intend to make a final 0.8 release within the next week, subject to
any issues that might be found in this candidate.

Thanks very much to all who have sent suggestions, bug reports, or=20
patches.  Please report any new issues in this release either to
bazaar-ng@lists.canonical.com, or through the bug tracker at
launchpad.net.

A summary of changes in this release follows:


  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Sftp paths can now be relative, or local, according to the lftp
      convention. Paths now take the form:
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/~/relative/path
      or
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/absolute/path

    * The FTP transport now tries to reconnect after a temporary
      failure. ftp put is made atomic. (Matthieu Moy)

    * The FTP transport now maintains a pool of connections, and
      reuses them to avoid multiple connections to the same host (like
      sftp did). (Daniel Silverstone)

    * The bzr_man.py file has been removed. To create the man page now,
      use ./generate_docs.py man. The new program can also create other fil=
es.
      Run "python generate_docs.py --help" for usage information. (Hans
      Ulrich Niedermann & James Blackwell).

    * Man Page now gives full help (James Blackwell). Help also updated to=
=20
      reflect user config now being stored in .bazaar (Hans Ulrich
      Niedermann)

    * It's now possible to set aliases in bazaar.conf (Erik B=C3=A5gfors)

    * Pull now accepts a --revision argument (Erik B=C3=A5gfors)

    * 'bzr re-sign' now allows multiple revisions to be supplied on the com=
mand
      line. You can now use the following command to sign all of your old c=
ommits.
        find .bzr/revision-store// -name my@email-* \
          | sed 's/.*\/\/..\///' \
          | xargs bzr re-sign

    * Upgrade can now upgrade over the network. (Robert Collins)

    * Two new commands 'bzr checkout' and 'bzr update' allow for CVS/SVN-al=
ike
      behaviour.  By default they will cache history in the checkout, but
      with --lightweight almost all data is kept in the master branch.
      (Robert Collins)

    * 'revert' unversions newly-versioned files, instead of deleting them.

    * 'merge' is more robust.  Conflict messages have changed.

    * 'merge' and 'revert' no longer clobber existing files that end in '~'=
 or
      '.moved'.

    * Default log format can be set in configuration and plugins can regist=
er
      their own formatters. (Erik B=C3=A5gfors)

    * New 'reconcile' command will check branch consistency and repair inde=
xes
      that can become out of sync in pre 0.8 formats. (Robert Collins,
      Daniel Silverstone)

    * New 'bzr init --format' and 'bzr upgrade --format' option to control=
=20
      what storage format is created or produced.  (Robert Collins,=20
      Martin Pool)

    * Add parent location to 'bzr info', if there is one.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * New developer commands 'weave-list' and 'weave-join'.  (Martin Pool)

    * New 'init-repository' command, plus support for repositories in 'init'
      and 'branch' (Aaron Bentley, Erik B=C3=A5gfors, Robert Collins)

    * Improve output of 'info' command. Show all relevant locations related=
 to
      working tree, branch and repository. Use kibibytes for binary quantit=
ies.
      Fix off-by-one error in missing revisions of working tree.  Make 'inf=
o'
      work on branches, repositories and remote locations.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * 'pull' and 'push' now normalise the revision history, so that any two
      branches with the same tip revision will have the same output from 'l=
og'.
      (Robert Collins)

    * 'merge' accepts --remember option to store parent location, like 'pus=
h'
      and 'pull'. (Olaf Conradi)

  CHANGES:

    * Commit is now verbose by default, and shows changed filenames and the=
=20
      new revision number.  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * Unify 'mv', 'move', 'rename'.  (#5379, Matthew Fuller)

    * 'bzr -h' shows help.  (#35940, Martin Pool, Ian Bicking)

    * Make 'pull' and 'push' remember location on failure using --remember.
      (Olaf Conradi)

  INTERNALS:
 =20
    * The internal storage of history, and logical branch identity have now
      been split into Branch, and Repository. The common locking and file=
=20
      management routines are now in bzrlib.lockablefiles.=20
      (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * Transports can now raise DependencyNotPresent if they need a library
      which is not installed, and then another implementation will be=20
      tried.  (Martin Pool)

    * Remove obsolete (and no-op) `decode` parameter to `Transport.get`. =
=20
      (Martin Pool)

    * Using Tree Transform for merge, revert, tree-building

    * WorkingTree.create, Branch.create, WorkingTree.create_standalone,
      Branch.initialize are now deprecated. Please see BzrDir.create_* for
      replacement API's. (Robert Collins)

    * New BzrDir class represents the .bzr control directory and manages
      formatting issues. (Robert Collins)

    * New repository.InterRepository class encapsulates Repository to=20
      Repository actions and allows for clean selection of optimised code
      paths. (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.fetch.fetch and bzrlib.fetch.greedy_fetch are now deprecated,
      please use 'branch.fetch' or 'repository.fetch' depending on your
      needs. (Robert Collins)

    * deprecated methods now have a 'is_deprecated' flag on them that can
      be checked, if you need to determine whether a given callable is=20
      deprecated at runtime. (Robert Collins)

    * Progress bars are now nested - see
      bzrlib.ui.ui_factory.nested_progress_bar. (Robert Collins, Robey Poin=
ter)

    * New API call get_format_description() for each type of format.
      (Olaf Conradi)

    * Changed branch.set_parent() to accept None to remove parent.
      (Olaf Conradi)

    * Deprecated BzrError AmbiguousBase.  (Olaf Conradi)

  TESTING:

    * SFTP tests now shortcut the SSH negotiation, reducing test overhead
      for testing SFTP protocol support. (Robey Pointer)

    * Branch formats are now tested once per implementation (see bzrlib.
      tests.branch_implementations. This is analagous to the transport
      interface tests, and has been followed up with working tree,
      repository and BzrDir tests. (Robert Collins)

    * New test base class TestCaseWithTransport provides a transport aware
      test environment, useful for testing any transport-interface using
      code. The test suite option --transport controls the transport used
      by this class (when its not being used as part of implementation
      contract testing). (Robert Collins)

    * Close logging handler on disabling the test log. This will remove the
      handler from the internal list inside python's logging module,
      preventing shutdown from closing it twice.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * Move test case for uncommit to blackbox tests.  (Olaf Conradi)

The long pending knit format has now been made the default format for
bzr. Any future changes to the knit format will done with backwards
compatibility.

This has some important consequences:
 * Existing test knit branches need to be recreated.
 * Any remaining bugs in knits are likely to show up very rapidly -
Martin and I will address them as quickly as possibly.

checkouts of branches over SFTP will now work acceptably as long as the
branch has been upgraded first.

Please do try out knits and report on their success. If you need to
create a non-knit branch, you can do this via 'bzr init
--format=3Dmetadir'.

Cheers,
Rob

I'd like to invite university students to work on Bazaar-NG as part of
the Google summer-of-code project.  By doing so you can earn a stipend
of USD 4500, contribute to open source development and gain some
exposure to both Canonical and Google, two of the more interesting
software companies around today.

We'd also like to invite other people to consider acting as mentors for
students - if you're interested please reply to me.

Bazaar projects are listed within this page:

  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GoogleSoC2006

please feel free to add or enhance projects there if you have ideas, or
discuss them on the list.

I'm happy to announce the release of bazaar-ng (bzr) 0.8.  This release
contains many improvements on 0.7, and upgrading is recommended for all
users.  This release supports a new storage format and upgrading
existing data is recommended but not required.

Source is available from=20

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/OfficialDownloads

If you're using the bzrtools plugin please note that a new version
which fully supports bzr 0.8 will be available shortly.

bzr 0.8  2006-05-08

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    Release 0.8 of bzr introduces a new format for history storage, called
    'knit', as an evolution of to the 'weave' format used in 0.7.  Local=20
    and remote operations are faster using knits than weaves.  Several
    operations including 'init', 'init-repo', and 'upgrade' take a=20
    --format option that controls this.  Branching from an existing branch
    will keep the same format.

    It is possible to merge, pull and push between branches of different
    formats but this is slower than moving data between homogenous
    branches.  It is therefore recommended (but not required) that you
    upgrade all branches for a project at the same time.  Information on
    formats is shown by 'bzr info'.

    bzr 0.8 now allows creation of 'repositories', which hold the history=
=20
    of files and revisions for several branches.  Previously bzr kept all
    the history for a branch within the .bzr directory at the root of the
    branch, and this is still the default.  To create a repository, use
    the new 'bzr init-repo' command.  Branches exist as directories under
    the repository and contain just a small amount of information
    indicating the current revision of the branch.

    bzr 0.8 also supports 'checkouts', which are similar to in cvs and
    subversion.  Checkouts are associated with a branch (optionally in a
    repository), which contains all the historical information.  The
    result is that a checkout can be deleted without losing any
    already-committed revisions.  A new 'update' command is also available.=
=20

    Repositories and checkouts are not supported with the 0.7 storage
    format.  To use them you must upgrad to either knits, or to the
    'metaweave' format, which uses weaves but changes the .bzr directory
    arrangement.
   =20

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Sftp paths can now be relative, or local, according to the lftp
      convention. Paths now take the form:
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/~/relative/path
      or
      sftp://user:pass@host:port/absolute/path

    * The FTP transport now tries to reconnect after a temporary
      failure. ftp put is made atomic. (Matthieu Moy)

    * The FTP transport now maintains a pool of connections, and
      reuses them to avoid multiple connections to the same host (like
      sftp did). (Daniel Silverstone)

    * The bzr_man.py file has been removed. To create the man page now,
      use ./generate_docs.py man. The new program can also create other fil=
es.
      Run "python generate_docs.py --help" for usage information. (Hans
      Ulrich Niedermann & James Blackwell).

    * Man Page now gives full help (James Blackwell). Help also updated to=
=20
      reflect user config now being stored in .bazaar (Hans Ulrich
      Niedermann)

    * It's now possible to set aliases in bazaar.conf (Erik B=E5gfors)

    * Pull now accepts a --revision argument (Erik B=E5gfors)

    * 'bzr re-sign' now allows multiple revisions to be supplied on the com=
mand
      line. You can now use the following command to sign all of your old c=
ommits.
        find .bzr/revision-store// -name my@email-* \
          | sed 's/.*\/\/..\///' \
          | xargs bzr re-sign

    * Upgrade can now upgrade over the network. (Robert Collins)

    * Two new commands 'bzr checkout' and 'bzr update' allow for CVS/SVN-al=
ike
      behaviour.  By default they will cache history in the checkout, but
      with --lightweight almost all data is kept in the master branch.
      (Robert Collins)

    * 'revert' unversions newly-versioned files, instead of deleting them.

    * 'merge' is more robust.  Conflict messages have changed.

    * 'merge' and 'revert' no longer clobber existing files that end in '~'=
 or
      '.moved'.

    * Default log format can be set in configuration and plugins can regist=
er
      their own formatters. (Erik B=E5gfors)

    * New 'reconcile' command will check branch consistency and repair inde=
xes
      that can become out of sync in pre 0.8 formats. (Robert Collins,
      Daniel Silverstone)

    * New 'bzr init --format' and 'bzr upgrade --format' option to control=
=20
      what storage format is created or produced.  (Robert Collins,=20
      Martin Pool)

    * Add parent location to 'bzr info', if there is one.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * New developer commands 'weave-list' and 'weave-join'.  (Martin Pool)

    * New 'init-repository' command, plus support for repositories in 'init'
      and 'branch' (Aaron Bentley, Erik B=E5gfors, Robert Collins)

    * Improve output of 'info' command. Show all relevant locations related=
 to
      working tree, branch and repository. Use kibibytes for binary quantit=
ies.
      Fix off-by-one error in missing revisions of working tree.  Make 'inf=
o'
      work on branches, repositories and remote locations.  Show locations
      relative to the shared repository, if applicable.  Show locking status
      of locations.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * Diff and merge now safely handle binary files. (Aaron Bentley)

    * 'pull' and 'push' now normalise the revision history, so that any two
      branches with the same tip revision will have the same output from 'l=
og'.
      (Robert Collins)

    * 'merge' accepts --remember option to store parent location, like 'pus=
h'
      and 'pull'. (Olaf Conradi)

    * bzr status and diff when files given as arguments do not exist
      in the relevant trees.  (Martin Pool, #3619)

    * Add '.hg' to the default ignore list.  (Martin Pool)

    * 'knit' is now the default disk format. This improves disk performance=
 and
      utilization, increases incremental pull performance, robustness with =
SFTP
      and allows checkouts over SFTP to perform acceptably.=20
      The initial Knit code was contributed by Johan Rydberg based on a
      specification by Martin Pool.
      (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley, John Rydberg, Martin Pool).

    * New tool to generate all-in-one html version of the manual.  (Alexand=
er
      Belchenko)

    * Hitting CTRL-C while doing an SFTP push will no longer cause stale lo=
cks
      to be left in the SFTP repository. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool).

    * New option 'diff --prefix' to control how files are named in diff
      output, with shortcuts '-p0' and '-p1' corresponding to the options f=
or=20
      GNU patch.  (Alexander Belchenko, Goffredo Baroncelli, Martin Pool)

    * Add --revision option to 'annotate' command.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * Add --revision option to 'annotate' command.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * If bzr shows an unexpected revision-history after pulling (perhaps due
      to a reweave) it can now be corrected by 'bzr reconcile'.
      (Robert Collins)

  CHANGES:

    * Commit is now verbose by default, and shows changed filenames and the=
=20
      new revision number.  (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * Unify 'mv', 'move', 'rename'.  (#5379, Matthew Fuller)

    * 'bzr -h' shows help.  (#35940, Martin Pool, Ian Bicking)

    * Make 'pull' and 'push' remember location on failure using --remember.
      (Olaf Conradi)

    * For compatibility, make old format for using weaves inside metadir
      available as 'metaweave' format.  Rename format 'metadir' to 'default=
'.
      Clean up help for option --format in commands 'init', 'init-repo' and
      'upgrade'.  (Olaf Conradi)

  INTERNALS:
 =20
    * The internal storage of history, and logical branch identity have now
      been split into Branch, and Repository. The common locking and file=
=20
      management routines are now in bzrlib.lockablefiles.=20
      (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * Transports can now raise DependencyNotPresent if they need a library
      which is not installed, and then another implementation will be=20
      tried.  (Martin Pool)

    * Remove obsolete (and no-op) `decode` parameter to `Transport.get`. =
=20
      (Martin Pool)

    * Using Tree Transform for merge, revert, tree-building

    * WorkingTree.create, Branch.create, WorkingTree.create_standalone,
      Branch.initialize are now deprecated. Please see BzrDir.create_* for
      replacement API's. (Robert Collins)

    * New BzrDir class represents the .bzr control directory and manages
      formatting issues. (Robert Collins)

    * New repository.InterRepository class encapsulates Repository to=20
      Repository actions and allows for clean selection of optimised code
      paths. (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.fetch.fetch and bzrlib.fetch.greedy_fetch are now deprecated,
      please use 'branch.fetch' or 'repository.fetch' depending on your
      needs. (Robert Collins)

    * deprecated methods now have a 'is_deprecated' flag on them that can
      be checked, if you need to determine whether a given callable is=20
      deprecated at runtime. (Robert Collins)

    * Progress bars are now nested - see
      bzrlib.ui.ui_factory.nested_progress_bar. (Robert Collins, Robey Poin=
ter)

    * New API call get_format_description() for each type of format.
      (Olaf Conradi)

    * Changed branch.set_parent() to accept None to remove parent.
      (Olaf Conradi)

    * Deprecated BzrError AmbiguousBase.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * WorkingTree.branch is now a read only property.  (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.ui.text.TextUIFactory now accepts a bar_type parameter which
      can be None or a factory that will create a progress bar. This is
      useful for testing or for overriding the bzrlib.progress heuristic.
      (Robert Collins)

    * New API method get_physical_lock_status() to query locks present on a
      transport.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * Repository.reconcile now takes a thorough keyword parameter to allow
      requesting an indepth reconciliation, rather than just a data-loss=20
      check. (Robert Collins)

    * bzrlib.ui.ui_factory protocol now supports 'get_boolean' to prompt
      the user for yes/no style input. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * SFTP tests now shortcut the SSH negotiation, reducing test overhead
      for testing SFTP protocol support. (Robey Pointer)

    * Branch formats are now tested once per implementation (see bzrlib.
      tests.branch_implementations. This is analagous to the transport
      interface tests, and has been followed up with working tree,
      repository and BzrDir tests. (Robert Collins)

    * New test base class TestCaseWithTransport provides a transport aware
      test environment, useful for testing any transport-interface using
      code. The test suite option --transport controls the transport used
      by this class (when its not being used as part of implementation
      contract testing). (Robert Collins)

    * Close logging handler on disabling the test log. This will remove the
      handler from the internal list inside python's logging module,
      preventing shutdown from closing it twice.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * Move test case for uncommit to blackbox tests.  (Olaf Conradi)

    * run_bzr and run_bzr_captured now accept a 'stdin=3D"foo"' parameter w=
hich
      will provide String("foo") to the command as its stdin.

I wrote simple plugin to show paths info for bzr itself and default
pull/push locations.

Usage
=====
usage: bzr show-paths

Show paths used by bzr itself and push/pull locations for current branch

options:
     --help, -h                show help message


Example
=======

E:\work\Python\bzr\devel\bzr.dev>bzr show-paths
   bzr executable: C:/Program Files/Bazaar-NG/bzr.EXE
           bzrlib: C:/Program Files/Bazaar-NG/lib/library.zip/bzrlib
   bzr config dir: C:/Documents and Settings/bialix/Application
Data/bazaar/2.0
bzr plugins dirs: C:/Program Files/Bazaar-NG/lib/library.zip/bzrlib/plugins
                 : E:/work/python/bzr/plugins.work
         .bzr.log: C:/.bzr.log

I've made a one-line fix for a missing line from setup.py so the current
version is now 0.8.2.

I'm happy to announce the release of Bazaar 0.9 (previously known as
Bazaar-NG).  This release includes many performance and usability
improvements, and I'd like to thank everyone who contributed fixes,
suggestions, or bug reports. =20

A detailed list of user-visible changes is attached to this mail.  A few
deserve special mention.  The built-in ignore patterns have now been
removed in favour of rules specified either in the tree or in the user's
configuration directory.  Users who have branches or repositories
created with earlier versions are encouraged to run 'bzr upgrade' to
update them to the most recent version, which can dramatically improve
performance.

Development is already underway for our next release, Bazaar 0.10, in
which we continue to focus on local and remote performance.

--=20
Martin


bzr 0.9.0  2006-08-11

  SURPRISES:

   * The hard-coded built-in ignore rules have been removed. There are
     now two rulesets which are enforced. A user global one in=20
     ~/.bazaar/ignore which will apply to every tree, and the tree
     specific one '.bzrignore'.
     ~/.bazaar/ignore will be created if it does not exist, but with
     a more conservative list than the old default.
     This fixes bugs with default rules being enforced no matter what.=20
     The old list of ignore rules from bzr is available by
     running 'bzr ignore --old-default-rules'.
     (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, John Arbash Meinel)

   * 'branches.conf' has been changed to 'locations.conf', since it can app=
ly
     to more locations than just branch locations.
     (Aaron Bentley)
  =20
  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * The revision specifier "revno:" is extended to accept the syntax
     revno:N:branch. For example,
     revno:42:http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev/ means revision 42 in
     bzr.dev.  (Matthieu Moy)

   * Tests updates to ensure proper URL handling, UNICODE support, and
     proper printing when the user's terminal encoding cannot display=20
     the path of a file that has been versioned.
     ``bzr branch`` can take a target URL rather than only a local director=
y.
     Branch.get_parent()/set_parent() now save a relative path if possible,
     and normalize the parent based on root, allowing access across
     different transports. (John Arbash Meinel, Wouter van Heyst, Martin Po=
ol)
     (Malone #48906, #42699, #40675, #5281, #3980, #36363, #43689,
      #42517, #42514)

   * On Unix, detect terminal width using an ioctl not just $COLUMNS.
     Use terminal width for single-line logs from ``bzr log --line`` and
     pending-merge display.  (Robert Widhopf-Fenk, Gustavo Niemeyer)
     (Malone #3507)

   * On Windows, detect terminal width using GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.
     (Alexander Belchenko)

   * Speedup improvement for 'date:'-revision search. (Guillaume Pinot).

   * Show the correct number of revisions pushed when pushing a new branch.
     (Robert Collins).

   * 'bzr selftest' now shows a progress bar with the number of tests, and=
=20
     progress made. 'make check' shows tests in -v mode, to be more useful
     for the PQM status window. (Robert Collins).
     When using a progress bar, failed tests are printed out, rather than
     being overwritten by the progress bar until the suite finishes.
     (John Arbash Meinel)

   * 'bzr selftest --benchmark' will run a new benchmarking selftest.
     'bzr selftest --benchmark --lsprof-timed' will use lsprofile to genera=
te
     profile data for the individual profiled calls, allowing for fine
     grained analysis of performance.
     (Robert Collins, Martin Pool).

   * 'bzr commit' shows a progress bar. This is useful for commits over sftp
     where commit can take an appreciable time. (Robert Collins)

   * 'bzr add' is now less verbose in telling you what ignore globs were
     matched by files being ignored. Instead it just tells you how many=20
     were ignored (because you might reasonably be expecting none to be
     ignored). 'bzr add -v' is unchanged and will report every ignored
     file. (Robert Collins).

   * ftp now has a test server if medusa is installed. As part of testing,
     ftp support has been improved, including support for supplying a
     non-standard port. (John Arbash Meinel).

   * 'bzr log --line' shows the revision number, and uses only the
     first line of the log message (#5162, Alexander Belchenko;
     Matthieu Moy)

   * 'bzr status' has had the --all option removed. The 'bzr ls' command
     should be used to retrieve all versioned files. (Robert Collins)

   * 'bzr bundle OTHER/BRANCH' will create a bundle which can be sent
     over email, and applied on the other end, while maintaining ancestry.
     This bundle can be applied with either 'bzr merge' or 'bzr pull',
     the same way you would apply another branch.
     (John Arbash Meinel, Aaron Bentley)
 =20
   * 'bzr whoami' can now be used to set your identity from the command lin=
e,
     for a branch or globally.  (Robey Pointer)

   * 'bzr checkout' now aliased to 'bzr co', and 'bzr annotate' to 'bzr ann=
'.
     (Michael Ellerman)

   * 'bzr revert DIRECTORY' now reverts the contents of the directory as we=
ll.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * 'bzr get sftp://foo' gives a better error when paramiko is not present.
     Also updates things like 'http+pycurl://' if pycurl is not present.
     (John Arbash Meinel) (Malone #47821, #52204)

   * New env variable BZR_PROGRESS_BAR, sets the default progress bar type.
     Can be set to 'none' or 'dummy' to disable the progress bar, 'dots' or=
=20
     'tty' to create the respective type. (John Arbash Meinel, #42197, #511=
07)

   * Improve the help text for 'bzr diff' to explain what various options d=
o.
     (John Arbash Meinel, #6391)

   * 'bzr uncommit -r 10' now uncommits revisions 11.. rather than uncommit=
ting
     revision 10. This makes -r10 more in line with what other commands do.
     'bzr uncommit' also now saves the pending merges of the revisions that
     were removed. So it is safe to uncommit after a merge, fix something,
     and commit again. (John Arbash Meinel, #32526, #31426)

   * 'bzr init' now also works on remote locations.
     (Wouter van Heyst, #48904)

   * HTTP support has been updated. When using pycurl we now support=20
     connection keep-alive, which reduces dns requests and round trips.
     And for both urllib and pycurl we support multi-range requests,=20
     which decreases the number of round-trips. Performance results for
     ``bzr branch http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev/`` indicate
     http branching is now 2-3x faster, and ``bzr pull`` in an existing=20
     branch is as much as 4x faster.
     (Michael Ellerman, Johan Rydberg, John Arbash Meinel, #46768)

   * Performance improvements for sftp. Branching and pulling are now up to
     2x faster. Utilize paramiko.readv() support for async requests if it
     is available (paramiko > 1.6) (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix shadowed definition of TestLocationConfig that caused some=20
      tests not to run.  (#32587, Erik B=E5gfors, Michael Ellerman,=20
      Martin Pool)

    * Fix unnecessary requirement of sign-my-commits that it be run from
      a working directory.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

    * 'bzr push location' will only remember the push location if it succee=
ds
      in connecting to the remote location. (#49742, John Arbash Meinel)

    * 'bzr revert' no longer toggles the executable bit on win32
      (#45010, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Handle broken pipe under win32 correctly. (John Arbash Meinel)
   =20
    * sftp tests now work correctly on win32 if you have a newer paramiko
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Cleanup win32 test suite, and general cleanup of places where
      file handles were being held open. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * When specifying filenames for 'diff -r x..y', the name of the file in=
 the
      working directory can be used, even if its name is different in both x
      and y.

    * File-ids containing single- or double-quotes are handled correctly by
      push.  (#52227, Aaron Bentley)

    * Normalize unicode filenames to ensure cross-platform consistency.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #43689)

    * The argument parser can now handle '-' as an argument. Currently
      no code interprets it specially (it is mostly handled as a file named=
=20
      '-'). But plugins, and future operations can use it.
      (John Arbash meinel, #50984)

    * Bundles can properly read binary files with a plain '\r' in them.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #51927)

    * Tuning iter_entries() to be more efficient (John Arbash Meinel, #5444)

    * Lots of win32 fixes (the test suite passes again).
      (John Arbash Meinel, #50155)

    * Handle openbsd returning None for sys.getfilesystemencoding() (#41183=
)=20

    * Support ftp APPE (append) to allow Knits to be used over ftp (#42592)

    * Removals are only committed if they match the filespec (or if there is
      no filespec).  (#46635, Aaron Bentley)

    * smart-add recurses through all supplied directories=20
      (John Arbash Meinel, #52578)

    * Make the bundle reader extra lines before and after the bundle text.
      This allows you to parse an email with the bundle inline.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #49182)

    * Change the file id generator to squash a little bit more. Helps when
      working with long filenames on windows. (Also helps for unicode filen=
ames
      not generating hidden files). (John Arbash Meinel, #43801)

    * Restore terminal mode on C-c while reading sftp password.  (#48923,=
=20
      Nicholas Allen, Martin Pool)

    * Timestamps are rounded to 1ms, and revision entries can be recreated
      exactly. (John Arbash Meinel, Jamie Wilkinson, #40693)

    * Branch.base has changed to a URL, but ~/.bazaar/locations.conf should
      use local paths, since it is user visible (John Arbash Meinel, #53653)

    * ``bzr status foo`` when foo was unversioned used to cause a full delta
      to be generated (John Arbash Meinel, #53638)

    * When reading revision properties, an empty value should be considered
      the empty string, not None (John Arbash Meinel, #47782)

    * ``bzr diff --diff-options`` can now handle binary files being changed.
      Also, the output is consistent when --diff-options is not supplied.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #54651, #52930)

    * Use the right suffixes for loading plugins (John Arbash Meinel, #5181=
0)

    * Fix Branch.get_parent() to handle the case when the parent is not=20
      accessible (John Arbash Meinel, #52976)

  INTERNALS:

    * Combine the ignore rules into a single regex rather than looping over
      them to reduce the threshold where  N^2 behaviour occurs in operations
      like status. (Jan Hudec, Robert Collins).

    * Appending to bzrlib.DEFAULT_IGNORE is now deprecated. Instead, use
      one of the add functions in bzrlib.ignores. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * 'bzr push' should only push the ancestry of the current revision, not
      all of the history in the repository. This is especially important for
      shared repositories. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * bzrlib.delta.compare_trees now iterates in alphabetically sorted orde=
r,
      rather than randomly walking the inventories. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Doctests are now run in temporary directories which are cleaned up wh=
en
      they finish, rather than using special ScratchDir/ScratchBranch objec=
ts.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Split ``check`` into separate methods on the branch and on the reposi=
tory,
      so that it can be specialized in ways that are useful or efficient for
      different formats.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

    * Deprecate Repository.all_revision_ids; most methods don't really need
      the global revision graph but only that part leading up to a particul=
ar
      revision.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

    * Add a BzrDirFormat control_formats list which allows for control form=
ats
      that do not use '.bzr' to store their data - i.e. '.svn', '.hg' etc.
      (Robert Collins, Jelmer Vernooij).

    * bzrlib.diff.external_diff can be redirected to any file-like object.
      Uses subprocess instead of spawnvp.
      (#4047, #48914, James Henstridge, John Arbash Meinel)

    * New command line option '--profile-imports', which will install a cus=
tom
      importer to log time to import modules and regex compilation time to=
=20
      sys.stderr (John Arbash Meinel)

    * 'EmptyTree' is now deprecated, please use repository.revision_tree(No=
ne)
      instead. (Robert Collins)

    * "RevisionTree" is now in bzrlib/revisiontree.py. (Robert Collins)

Well folks, its the 28th of August, and as promised, here is a time
based release candidate of 0.10.

Tarball:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.10rc1.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.10rc1.tar.gz.sig


We've got a number of good things into 0.10 even though its not as
massive a release as 0.9 was :).

In one week, if there are no regressions reported by early adopters, I
will make a 0.10 final release.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.10rc1 below:

bzr 0.10.0RC1  2006-08-28
 =20
  IMPROVEMENTS:
    * 'merge' now takes --uncommitted, to apply uncommitted changes from a
      tree.  (Aaron Bentley)
 =20
    * 'bzr add --file-ids-from' can be used to specify another path to use
      for creating file ids, rather than generating all new ones. Internall=
y,
      the 'action' passed to smart_add_tree() can return file_ids that
      will be used, rather than having bzrlib generate new ones.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #55781)

    * ``bzr selftest --benchmark`` now allows a ``--cache-dir`` parameter.
      This will cache some of the intermediate trees, and decrease the
      setup time for benchmark tests. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Inverse forms are provided for all boolean options.  For example,
      --strict has --no-strict, --no-recurse has --recurse (Aaron Bentley)

    * Serialize out Inventories directly, rather than using ElementTree.
      Writing out a kernel sized inventory drops from 2s down to ~350ms.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Help diffutils 2.8.4 get along with binary tests (Marien Zwart: #5761=
4)

    * Change LockDir so that if the lock directory doesn't exist when
      lock_write() is called, an attempt will be made to create it.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56974)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` preserves pending merges. (John Arbash Meinel, #5766=
0)

    * Active FTP transport now works as intended. (ghozzy, #56472)

    * Really fix mutter() so that it won't ever raise a UnicodeError.
      It means it is possible for ~/.bzr.log to contain non UTF-8 character=
s.
      But it is a debugging log, not a real user file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56947, #53880)

    * Change Command handle to allow Unicode command and options.
      At present we cannot register Unicode command names, so we will get
      BzrCommandError('unknown command'), or BzrCommandError('unknown optio=
n')
      But that is better than a UnicodeError + a traceback.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #57123)

    * Handle TZ=3DUTC properly when reading/writing revisions.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #55783, #56290)

    * Use GPG_TTY to allow gpg --cl to work with gpg-agent in a pipeline,
      (passing text to sign in on stdin). (John Arbash Meinel, #54468)

    * External diff does the right thing for binaries even in foreign=20
      languages. (John Arbash Meinel, #56307)

    * Testament handles more cases when content is unicode. Specific bug wa=
s
      in handling of revision properties. (John Arbash Meinel, Holger Kreke=
l,
      #54723)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``bzrlib.cache_utf8`` contains ``encode()`` and ``decode()`` function=
s
      which can be used to cache the conversion between utf8 and Unicode.
      Especially helpful for some of the knit annotation code, which has to
      convert revision ids to utf8 to annotate lines in storage.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``setup.py`` now searches the filesystem to find all packages which
      need to be installed. This should help make the life of packagers
      easier. (John Arbash Meinel)

Hi,=20
   Etienne found a bug in 0.10rc1 and 0.9
(https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+bug/58057) while testing 0.9
packages for inclusion into dapper. John prepared a fix, which I've
tweaked a little and merged into 0.10. The bug only affects running of
selftest in an installed copy of bzr.

So 0.10rc2 is now available, at
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.10rc2.tar.gz with a signature
at http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.10rc2.tar.gz.sig.

Cheers,
Rob

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm happy to announce the release of BzrTools 0.10.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.10.x Bazaar series.
I am too cheap to offer a release candidate-- this is 0.10.0final.  Any
bugs found will lead to a 0.10.1 release.

BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or frivolous
functionality for bzr.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

The changes in this release are mostly minor.  (It's been only 13 days
since 0.9.0)
1. Shelf was updated to match Michael's latest
2. baz-import was sped up by removing a pointless merge
3. bzrtools import time was improved by avoiding importing PyBaz unless
using baz-import or baz-import-branch.
4. shove was deprecated in favour of merge --uncommitted
5. API usage was updated to match bzrlib 0.10.0

tarball: http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.10.0.tar.gz
signature:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.10.0.tar.gz.sig

0.10.0 corresponds with revno 439 of
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzr/bzrtools

Enjoy!

Aaron

Note to packagers: I would greatly prefer if you shipped bzrtools 0.10.0
with bzr 0.10.0.  However, if you choose to ship an earlier version of
bzrtools, please contact me so I can advise how to ensure proper
compatibility.

    * Change LockDir so that if the lock directory doesn't exist when
      lock_write() is called, an attempt will be made to create it.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56974)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` preserves pending merges. (John Arbash Meinel, #5766=
0)

    * Active FTP transport now works as intended. (ghozzy, #56472)

    * Really fix mutter() so that it won't ever raise a UnicodeError.
      It means it is possible for ~/.bzr.log to contain non UTF-8 character=
s.
      But it is a debugging log, not a real user file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56947, #53880)

    * Change Command handle to allow Unicode command and options.
      At present we cannot register Unicode command names, so we will get
      BzrCommandError('unknown command'), or BzrCommandError('unknown optio=
n')
      But that is better than a UnicodeError + a traceback.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #57123)

    * Handle TZ=3DUTC properly when reading/writing revisions.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #55783, #56290)

    * Use GPG_TTY to allow gpg --cl to work with gpg-agent in a pipeline,
      (passing text to sign in on stdin). (John Arbash Meinel, #54468)

    * External diff does the right thing for binaries even in foreign=20
      languages. (John Arbash Meinel, #56307)

    * Testament handles more cases when content is unicode. Specific bug wa=
s
      in handling of revision properties. (John Arbash Meinel, Holger Kreke=
l,
      #54723)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``bzrlib.cache_utf8`` contains ``encode()`` and ``decode()`` function=
s
      which can be used to cache the conversion between utf8 and Unicode.
      Especially helpful for some of the knit annotation code, which has to
      convert revision ids to utf8 to annotate lines in storage.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``setup.py`` now searches the filesystem to find all packages which
      need to be installed. This should help make the life of packagers
      easier. (John Arbash Meinel)

Its time for our second time based release. This is the first release
candidate for bzr 0.11 and is suitable for widespread testing.


Tarballs:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.11rc1.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.11rc1.tar.gz.sig


This release fixes a number of critical and high importance bugs,
introduces API changes in preparation for future features (specifically
our future working tree optimisation, and the nested trees).

Launchpad has a good list of the bugs and features for 0.11:
https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+milestone/0.11

If there are no regressions encountered in 0.11rc1, 0.11 final will be
release on the 2nd October.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.11rc1 below:

bzr 0.11rc1  2006-09-25

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Knit files now wait to create their contents until the first data is
      added. The old code used to create an empty .knit and a .kndx with ju=
st
      the header. However, this caused a lot of extra round trips over sftp=
.
      This can change the time for ``bzr push`` to create a new remote bran=
ch
      from 160s down to 100s. This also affects ``bzr commit`` performance =
when
      adding new files, ``bzr commit`` on a new kernel-like tree drops from=
 50s
      down to 40s (John Arbash Meinel, #44692)

    * When an entire subtree has been deleted, commit will now report that
      just the top of the subtree has been deleted, rather than reporting
      all the individual items. (Robert Collins)

    * Commit performs one less XML parse. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr checkout`` now operates on readonly branches as well
      as readwrite branches. This fixes bug #39542. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr bind`` no longer synchronises history with the master branch.
      Binding should be followed by an update or push to synchronise the=20
      two branches. This is closely related to the fix for bug #39542.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.lazy_import.lazy_import`` function to create on-demand=20
      objects.  This allows all imports to stay at the global scope, but
      modules will not actually be imported if they are not used.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Support bzr:// and bzr+ssh:// urls to work with the new RPC-based
      transport which will be used with the upcoming high-performance smart
      server. The new command ``bzr serve`` will invoke bzr in server mode,
      which processes these requests. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, Mar=
tin
      Pool)

    * New command ``bzr version-info`` which can be used to get a summary
      of the current state of the tree. This is especially useful as part
      of a build commands. See ``doc/version_info.txt`` for more informatio=
n=20
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * 'bzr inventory [FILE...]' allows restricting the file list to a
      specific set of files. (John Arbash Meinel, #3631)

    * Don't abort when annotating empty files (John Arbash Meinel, #56814)

    * Add ``Stanza.to_unicode()`` which can be passed to another Stanza
      when nesting stanzas. Also, add ``read_stanza_unicode`` to handle whe=
n
      reading a nested Stanza. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Transform._set_mode() needs to stat the right file.=20
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56549)

    * Raise WeaveFormatError rather than StopIteration when trying to read
      an empty Weave file. (John Arbash Meinel, #46871)

    * Don't access e.code for generic URLErrors, only HTTPErrors have .code=
.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #59835)

    * Handle boundary=3D"" lines properly to allow access through a Squid p=
roxy.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #57723)

    * revert now removes newly-added directories (Aaron Bentley, #54172)

    * ``bzr upgrade sftp://`` shouldn't fail to upgrade v6 branches if ther=
e=20
      isn't a working tree. (David Allouche, #40679)

    * Give nicer error messages when a user supplies an invalid --revision
      parameter. (John Arbash Meinel, #55420)

    * Handle when LANG is not recognized by python. Emit a warning, but
      just revert to using 'ascii'. (John Arbash Meinel, #35392)

    * Don't use preexec_fn on win32, as it is not supported by subprocess.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Skip specific tests when the dependencies aren't met. This includes
      some ``setup.py`` tests when ``python-dev`` is not available, and
      some tests that depend on paramiko. (John Arbash Meinel, Mattheiu Moy=
)

    * Fallback to Paramiko properly, if no ``ssh`` executable exists on
      the system. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``Branch.bind(other_branch)`` no longer takes a write lock on the
      other branch, and will not push or pull between the two branches.
      API users will need to perform a push or pull or update operation if =
they
      require branch synchronisation to take place. (Robert Collins, #47344=
)

    * When creating a tarball or zipfile export, export unicode names as ut=
f-8
      paths. This may not work perfectly on all platforms, but has the best
      chance of working in the common case. (John Arbash Meinel, #56816)

    * When committing, only files that exist in working tree or basis tree
      may be specified (Aaron Bentley, #50793)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Fixes to run on Python 2.5 (Brian M. Carlson, Martin Pool, Marien Zwa=
rt)

  INTERNALS:

    * TestCaseInTempDir now creates a separate directory for HOME, rather
      than having HOME set to the same location as the working directory.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * run_bzr_subprocess() can take an optional 'env_changes=3D{}' paramete=
r,
      which will update os.environ inside the spawned child. It also can
      take a 'universal_newlines=3DTrue', which helps when checking the out=
put
      of the command. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Refactor SFTP vendors to allow easier re-use when ssh is used.=20
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Transport.list_dir() and Transport.iter_files_recursive() should alwa=
ys
      return urlescaped paths. This is now tested (there were bugs in a few
      of the transports) (Andrew Bennetts, David Allouche, John Arbash Mein=
el)

    * New utility function symbol_versioning.deprecation_string. Returns th=
e
      formatted string for a callable, deprecation format pair. (Robert Col=
lins)

    * New TestCase helper applyDeprecated. This allows you to call a callab=
le
      which is deprecated without it spewing to the screen, just by supplyi=
ng
      the deprecation format string issued for it. (Robert Collins)

    * Transport.append and Transport.put have been deprecated in favor of
      .append_bytes, .append_file, .put_bytes, and .put_file. This removes =
the
      ambiguity in what type of object the functions take.
      Transport.non_atomic_put_{bytes,file} has also been added. Which work=
s
      similarly to Transport.append() except for SFTP, it doesn't have a ro=
und
      trip when opening the file. Also, it provides functionality for creat=
ing
      a parent directory when trying to create a file, rather than raise
      NoSuchFile and forcing the caller to repeat their request.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * WorkingTree has a new api ``unversion`` which allow the unversioning =
of
      entries by their file id. (Robert Collins)

    * WorkingTree.pending_merges is deprecated.  Please use the get_parent_=
ids
      (introduced in 0.10) method instead. (Robert Collins)

    * WorkingTree has a new lock_tree_write method which locks the branch f=
or
      read rather than write. This is appropriate for actions which only ne=
ed
      the branch data for reference rather than mutation. A new decorator
      needs_tree_write_lock is provided in the workingtree module. Like the
      needs_read_lock and needs_write_lock decorators this allows static=20
      declaration of the locking requirements of a function to ensure that
      a lock is taken out for casual scripts. (Robert Collins)

    * All WorkingTree methods which write to the tree, but not to the branc=
h
      have been converted to use ``needs_tree_write_lock`` rather than=20
      ``needs_write_lock``. Also converted is the revert, conflicts and tre=
e
      transform modules. This provides a modest performance improvement on=20
      metadir style trees, due to the reduce lock-acquisition, and a more
      significant performance improvement on lightweight checkouts from=20
      remote branches, where trivial operations used to pay a significant=20
      penalty. It also provides the basis for allowing readonly checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Special case importing the standard library 'copy' module. This shave=
s
      off 40ms of startup time, while retaining compatibility. See:
      ``bzrlib/inspect_for_copy.py`` for more details. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * WorkingTree has a new parent class MutableTree which represents the=20
      specialisations of Tree which are able to be altered. (Robert Collins=
)

    * New methods mkdir and put_file_bytes_non_atomic on MutableTree that
      mutate the tree and its contents. (Robert Collins)

    * Transport behaviour at the root of the URL is now defined and tested.
      (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * New test helper classs MemoryTree. This is typically accessed via
      ``self.make_branch_and_memory_tree()`` in test cases. (Robert Collins=
)
     =20
    * Add start_bzr_subprocess and stop_bzr_subprocess to allow test code t=
o
      continue running concurrently with a subprocess of bzr. (Andrew Benne=
tts,
      Robert Collins)

    * Add a new method ``Transport.get_smart_client()``. This is provided t=
o
      allow upgrades to a richer interface than the VFS one provided by
      Transport. (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

I'm happy to announce the release of BzrTools 0.11.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.11.x Bazaar series.

BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or frivolous
functionality for bzr.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

Very little has changed since bzr 0.10.0:
- - The 'shove' command has been removed (was deprecated in 0.10.0), in
favour of merge --uncommitted
- - API has been updated
- - The test suite passes even when PyBaz is not installed.

BzrTools 0.11.0 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.11.0.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

I'm happy to announce the release of bzr 0.11. This release is stable
and suitable for general deployment.

Tarballs:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.11.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.11.tar.gz.sig

This release fixes a number of critical and high importance bugs,
introduces API changes in preparation for future features (specifically
our future working tree optimisation, and the nested trees).

Launchpad has a good list of the bugs and features for 0.11:
https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+milestone/0.11

The next planned release of bzr is the release candidate for 0.12 due
October 23rd 2006.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.11 below:

bzr 0.11  2006-10-02

    * Smart server transport test failures on windows fixed. (Luk=C3=A1=C5=
=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD).

bzr 0.11rc2  2006-09-27

  BUG FIXES:

    * Test suite hangs on windows fixed. (Andrew Bennets, Alexander Belchen=
ko).
   =20
    * Commit performance regression fixed. (Aaron Bentley, Robert Collins, =
John
      Arbash Meinel).

bzr 0.11rc1  2006-09-25

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Knit files now wait to create their contents until the first data is
      added. The old code used to create an empty .knit and a .kndx with ju=
st
      the header. However, this caused a lot of extra round trips over sftp=
.
      This can change the time for ``bzr push`` to create a new remote bran=
ch
      from 160s down to 100s. This also affects ``bzr commit`` performance =
when
      adding new files, ``bzr commit`` on a new kernel-like tree drops from=
 50s
      down to 40s (John Arbash Meinel, #44692)

    * When an entire subtree has been deleted, commit will now report that
      just the top of the subtree has been deleted, rather than reporting
      all the individual items. (Robert Collins)

    * Commit performs one less XML parse. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr checkout`` now operates on readonly branches as well
      as readwrite branches. This fixes bug #39542. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr bind`` no longer synchronises history with the master branch.
      Binding should be followed by an update or push to synchronise the=20
      two branches. This is closely related to the fix for bug #39542.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.lazy_import.lazy_import`` function to create on-demand=20
      objects.  This allows all imports to stay at the global scope, but
      modules will not actually be imported if they are not used.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Support bzr:// and bzr+ssh:// urls to work with the new RPC-based
      transport which will be used with the upcoming high-performance smart
      server. The new command ``bzr serve`` will invoke bzr in server mode,
      which processes these requests. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, Mar=
tin
      Pool)

    * New command ``bzr version-info`` which can be used to get a summary
      of the current state of the tree. This is especially useful as part
      of a build commands. See ``doc/version_info.txt`` for more informatio=
n=20
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * 'bzr inventory [FILE...]' allows restricting the file list to a
      specific set of files. (John Arbash Meinel, #3631)

    * Don't abort when annotating empty files (John Arbash Meinel, #56814)

    * Add ``Stanza.to_unicode()`` which can be passed to another Stanza
      when nesting stanzas. Also, add ``read_stanza_unicode`` to handle whe=
n
      reading a nested Stanza. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Transform._set_mode() needs to stat the right file.=20
      (John Arbash Meinel, #56549)

    * Raise WeaveFormatError rather than StopIteration when trying to read
      an empty Weave file. (John Arbash Meinel, #46871)

    * Don't access e.code for generic URLErrors, only HTTPErrors have .code=
.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #59835)

    * Handle boundary=3D"" lines properly to allow access through a Squid p=
roxy.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #57723)

    * revert now removes newly-added directories (Aaron Bentley, #54172)

    * ``bzr upgrade sftp://`` shouldn't fail to upgrade v6 branches if ther=
e=20
      isn't a working tree. (David Allouche, #40679)

    * Give nicer error messages when a user supplies an invalid --revision
      parameter. (John Arbash Meinel, #55420)

    * Handle when LANG is not recognized by python. Emit a warning, but
      just revert to using 'ascii'. (John Arbash Meinel, #35392)

    * Don't use preexec_fn on win32, as it is not supported by subprocess.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Skip specific tests when the dependencies aren't met. This includes
      some ``setup.py`` tests when ``python-dev`` is not available, and
      some tests that depend on paramiko. (John Arbash Meinel, Mattheiu Moy=
)

    * Fallback to Paramiko properly, if no ``ssh`` executable exists on
      the system. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``Branch.bind(other_branch)`` no longer takes a write lock on the
      other branch, and will not push or pull between the two branches.
      API users will need to perform a push or pull or update operation if =
they
      require branch synchronisation to take place. (Robert Collins, #47344=
)

    * When creating a tarball or zipfile export, export unicode names as ut=
f-8
      paths. This may not work perfectly on all platforms, but has the best
      chance of working in the common case. (John Arbash Meinel, #56816)

    * When committing, only files that exist in working tree or basis tree
      may be specified (Aaron Bentley, #50793)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Fixes to run on Python 2.5 (Brian M. Carlson, Martin Pool, Marien Zwa=
rt)

  INTERNALS:

    * TestCaseInTempDir now creates a separate directory for HOME, rather
      than having HOME set to the same location as the working directory.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * run_bzr_subprocess() can take an optional 'env_changes=3D{}' paramete=
r,
      which will update os.environ inside the spawned child. It also can
      take a 'universal_newlines=3DTrue', which helps when checking the out=
put
      of the command. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Refactor SFTP vendors to allow easier re-use when ssh is used.=20
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Transport.list_dir() and Transport.iter_files_recursive() should alwa=
ys
      return urlescaped paths. This is now tested (there were bugs in a few
      of the transports) (Andrew Bennetts, David Allouche, John Arbash Mein=
el)

    * New utility function symbol_versioning.deprecation_string. Returns th=
e
      formatted string for a callable, deprecation format pair. (Robert Col=
lins)

    * New TestCase helper applyDeprecated. This allows you to call a callab=
le
      which is deprecated without it spewing to the screen, just by supplyi=
ng
      the deprecation format string issued for it. (Robert Collins)

    * Transport.append and Transport.put have been deprecated in favor of
      .append_bytes, .append_file, .put_bytes, and .put_file. This removes =
the
      ambiguity in what type of object the functions take.
      Transport.non_atomic_put_{bytes,file} has also been added. Which work=
s
      similarly to Transport.append() except for SFTP, it doesn't have a ro=
und
      trip when opening the file. Also, it provides functionality for creat=
ing
      a parent directory when trying to create a file, rather than raise
      NoSuchFile and forcing the caller to repeat their request.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * WorkingTree has a new api ``unversion`` which allow the unversioning =
of
      entries by their file id. (Robert Collins)

    * WorkingTree.pending_merges is deprecated.  Please use the get_parent_=
ids
      (introduced in 0.10) method instead. (Robert Collins)

    * WorkingTree has a new lock_tree_write method which locks the branch f=
or
      read rather than write. This is appropriate for actions which only ne=
ed
      the branch data for reference rather than mutation. A new decorator
      needs_tree_write_lock is provided in the workingtree module. Like the
      needs_read_lock and needs_write_lock decorators this allows static=20
      declaration of the locking requirements of a function to ensure that
      a lock is taken out for casual scripts. (Robert Collins)

    * All WorkingTree methods which write to the tree, but not to the branc=
h
      have been converted to use ``needs_tree_write_lock`` rather than=20
      ``needs_write_lock``. Also converted is the revert, conflicts and tre=
e
      transform modules. This provides a modest performance improvement on=20
      metadir style trees, due to the reduce lock-acquisition, and a more
      significant performance improvement on lightweight checkouts from=20
      remote branches, where trivial operations used to pay a significant=20
      penalty. It also provides the basis for allowing readonly checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Special case importing the standard library 'copy' module. This shave=
s
      off 40ms of startup time, while retaining compatibility. See:
      ``bzrlib/inspect_for_copy.py`` for more details. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * WorkingTree has a new parent class MutableTree which represents the=20
      specialisations of Tree which are able to be altered. (Robert Collins=
)

    * New methods mkdir and put_file_bytes_non_atomic on MutableTree that
      mutate the tree and its contents. (Robert Collins)

    * Transport behaviour at the root of the URL is now defined and tested.
      (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * New test helper classs MemoryTree. This is typically accessed via
      ``self.make_branch_and_memory_tree()`` in test cases. (Robert Collins=
)
     =20
    * Add start_bzr_subprocess and stop_bzr_subprocess to allow test code t=
o
      continue running concurrently with a subprocess of bzr. (Andrew Benne=
tts,
      Robert Collins)

    * Add a new method ``Transport.get_smart_client()``. This is provided t=
o
      allow upgrades to a richer interface than the VFS one provided by
      Transport. (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm happy to announce the release of BzrTools 0.12.0.

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.12.x Bazaar series.

BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or frivolous
functionality for bzr.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

Very little has changed since bzr 0.11.0:
- - bzrlib API usage has been updated
- - A bug causing cbranch to set the parent incorrectly has been fixed.
- - The directory in the tarball no longer contains version numbers, to
  encourage people to install it as 'bzrtools'.

BzrTools 0.12.0 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.12.0.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.12.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

Our third time based release took somewhat longer than the earlier two
cycles. We are still on schedule though with the first release candidate
for bzr 0.13 suitable for widespread testing on November the 27th.
(just ignore the fact that I don't adhere to 'my' timezone)


Tarballs:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.13rc1.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.13rc1.tar.gz.sig

Release branch:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.0.13

A list of all bugs and features for 0.13 is kept by Launchpad at:
    https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+milestone/0.13


This release fixes a number of bugs. Some highlights include ongoing
effort on the smart server, improvements to dealing with branches via
http (robuster range handling, keepalive) and extending the help system
to be able to deal with topics that aren't commands. I hope to see more
use being made of that last item to get really good 'online' help.


Barring any regressions, I expect the 0.13 final to be released December 4t=
h.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.13rc1 below:

bzr 0.13rc1  2006-11-27

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New command ``bzr remove-tree`` allows the removal of the working
      tree from a branch.
      (Daniel Silverstone)

    * urllib uses shared keep-alive connections, so http=20
      operations are substantially faster.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #53654)

    * ``bzr export`` allows an optional branch parameter, to export a bzr
      tree from some other url. For example:
      ``bzr export bzr.tar.gz http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev``
      (Daniel Silverstone)

    * Added ``bzr help topics`` to the bzr help system. This gives a
      location for general information, outside of a specific command.
      This includes updates for ``bzr help revisionspec`` the first topic
      included. (Goffredo Baroncelli, John Arbash Meinel, #42714)
     =20
    * WSGI-compatible HTTP smart server.  See ``doc/http_smart_server.txt``.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Knit files will now cache full texts only when the size of the
      deltas is as large as the size of the fulltext. (Or after 200
      deltas, whichever comes first). This has the most benefit on large
      files with small changes, such as the inventory for a large project.
      (eg For a project with 2500 files, and 7500 revisions, it changes
      the size of inventory.knit from 11MB to 5.4MB) (John Arbash Meinel)

  INTERNALS:

    * New -D option given before the command line turns on debugging output
      for particular areas.  -Derror shows tracebacks on all errors.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Clean up ``bzr selftest --benchmark bundle`` to correct an import,
      and remove benchmarks that take longer than 10min to run.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Use ``time.time()`` instead of ``time.clock()`` to decide on
      progress throttling. Because ``time.clock()`` is actually CPU time,
      so over a high-latency connection, too many updates get throttled.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``MemoryTransport.list_dir()`` would strip the first character for
      files or directories in root directory. (John Arbash Meinel)
 =20
    * New ``ChrootTransportDecorator``, accessible via the ``chroot+`` url
      prefix.  It disallows any access to locations above a set URL.  (Andr=
ew
      Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzrlib/bzrdir.py`` was directly referencing ``bzrlib.workingtree``,
      without importing it. This prevented ``bzr upgrade`` from working
      unless a plugin already imported ``bzrlib.workingtree``
      (John Arbash Meinel, #70716)

    * Suppress the traceback on invalid URLs (Vincent Ladeuil, #70803).

    * Give nicer error message when an http server returns a 403
      error code. (Vincent Ladeuil, #57644).

    * When a multi-range http GET request fails, try a single
      range one. If it fails too, forget about ranges. Remember that until=
=20
      the death of the transport and propagates that to the clones.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #62276, #62029).

    * Handles user/passwords supplied in url from command
      line (for the urllib implementation). Don't request already
      known passwords (Vincent Ladeuil, #42383, #44647, #48527)

    * _KnitIndex.add_versions() dictionary compresses revision ids as they
      are added. This fixes bug where fetching remote revisions records
      them as full references rather than integers. (John Arbash Meinel,
      #64789)

    * ``bzr ignore`` strips trailing slashes in patterns.
      Also ``bzr ignore`` rejects absolute paths. (Kent Gibson, #4559)

    * ``bzr ignore`` takes multiple arguments. (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #2948=
8)

    * mv correctly handles paths that traverse symlinks.=20
      (Aaron Bentley, #66964)

    * Give nicer looking error messages when failing to connect over ssh.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #49172)

    * Pushing to a remote branch does not currently update the remote worki=
ng
      tree. After a remote push, ``bzr status`` and ``bzr diff`` on the rem=
ote
      machine now show that the working tree is out of date.
      (Cheuksan Edward Wang #48136)

    * Use patiencediff instead of difflib for determining deltas to insert
      into knits. This avoids the O(N^3) behavior of difflib. Patience
      diff should be O(N^2). (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #65714)

    * Running ``bzr log`` on nonexistent file gives an error instead of the
      entire log history. (Cheuksan Edward Wang #50793)

    * ``bzr cat`` can look up contents of removed or renamed files. If the
      pathname is ambiguous, i.e. the files in the old and new trees have
      different id's, the default is the file in the new tree. The user can
      use "--name-from-revision" to select the file in the old tree.
      (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #30190)

  TESTING:

    * TestingHTTPRequestHandler really handles the Range header
      (previously it was ignoring it and returning the whole file,).

Hi all,

I've just released PyBaz 1.5.  This is a quick and dirty release, though
I have tested it extensively with baz-import.

The main purpose is to have a release available which is compatible with
baz-1.4.

It works with its own test suite (though it spews loads of deprecation
warnings).  It works with baz-import.  More than this I cannot say.

The release can be found at the new PyBaz home page:
http://code.aaronbentley.com/pybaz/

Tarball:
http://code.aaronbentley.com/pybaz/releases/pybaz-1.5.tar.gz

GPG signature:
http://code.aaronbentley.com/pybaz/releases/pybaz-1.5.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

I'm pleased to announce the release of bzr 0.13. This release is stable
and suitable for general deployment.

Tarballs:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.13.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.13.tar.gz.sig

Release branch:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.0.13

A list of all bugs and features for 0.13 is kept by Launchpad at:
    https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+milestone/0.13


This release fixes a number of bugs. Some highlights include ongoing
effort on the smart server, improvements to dealing with branches via
http (more robust range handling, keepalive) and extending the help
system to be able to deal with topics that aren't commands.


Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.13 below:

  No changes from 0.13rc1
   =20
bzr 0.13rc1  2006-11-27

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New command ``bzr remove-tree`` allows the removal of the working
      tree from a branch.
      (Daniel Silverstone)

    * urllib uses shared keep-alive connections, so http=20
      operations are substantially faster.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #53654)

    * ``bzr export`` allows an optional branch parameter, to export a bzr
      tree from some other url. For example:
      ``bzr export bzr.tar.gz http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.dev``
      (Daniel Silverstone)

    * Added ``bzr help topics`` to the bzr help system. This gives a
      location for general information, outside of a specific command.
      This includes updates for ``bzr help revisionspec`` the first topic
      included. (Goffredo Baroncelli, John Arbash Meinel, #42714)
     =20
    * WSGI-compatible HTTP smart server.  See ``doc/http_smart_server.txt``.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Knit files will now cache full texts only when the size of the
      deltas is as large as the size of the fulltext. (Or after 200
      deltas, whichever comes first). This has the most benefit on large
      files with small changes, such as the inventory for a large project.
      (eg For a project with 2500 files, and 7500 revisions, it changes
      the size of inventory.knit from 11MB to 5.4MB) (John Arbash Meinel)

  INTERNALS:

    * New -D option given before the command line turns on debugging output
      for particular areas.  -Derror shows tracebacks on all errors.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Clean up ``bzr selftest --benchmark bundle`` to correct an import,
      and remove benchmarks that take longer than 10min to run.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Use ``time.time()`` instead of ``time.clock()`` to decide on
      progress throttling. Because ``time.clock()`` is actually CPU time,
      so over a high-latency connection, too many updates get throttled.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``MemoryTransport.list_dir()`` would strip the first character for
      files or directories in root directory. (John Arbash Meinel)
 =20
    * New ``ChrootTransportDecorator``, accessible via the ``chroot+`` url
      prefix.  It disallows any access to locations above a set URL.  (Andr=
ew
      Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzrlib/bzrdir.py`` was directly referencing ``bzrlib.workingtree``,
      without importing it. This prevented ``bzr upgrade`` from working
      unless a plugin already imported ``bzrlib.workingtree``
      (John Arbash Meinel, #70716)

    * Suppress the traceback on invalid URLs (Vincent Ladeuil, #70803).

    * Give nicer error message when an http server returns a 403
      error code. (Vincent Ladeuil, #57644).

    * When a multi-range http GET request fails, try a single
      range one. If it fails too, forget about ranges. Remember that until=
=20
      the death of the transport and propagates that to the clones.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #62276, #62029).

    * Handles user/passwords supplied in url from command
      line (for the urllib implementation). Don't request already
      known passwords (Vincent Ladeuil, #42383, #44647, #48527)

    * _KnitIndex.add_versions() dictionary compresses revision ids as they
      are added. This fixes bug where fetching remote revisions records
      them as full references rather than integers. (John Arbash Meinel,
      #64789)

    * ``bzr ignore`` strips trailing slashes in patterns.
      Also ``bzr ignore`` rejects absolute paths. (Kent Gibson, #4559)

    * ``bzr ignore`` takes multiple arguments. (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #2948=
8)

    * mv correctly handles paths that traverse symlinks.=20
      (Aaron Bentley, #66964)

    * Give nicer looking error messages when failing to connect over ssh.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #49172)

    * Pushing to a remote branch does not currently update the remote worki=
ng
      tree. After a remote push, ``bzr status`` and ``bzr diff`` on the rem=
ote
      machine now show that the working tree is out of date.
      (Cheuksan Edward Wang #48136)

    * Use patiencediff instead of difflib for determining deltas to insert
      into knits. This avoids the O(N^3) behavior of difflib. Patience
      diff should be O(N^2). (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #65714)

    * Running ``bzr log`` on nonexistent file gives an error instead of the
      entire log history. (Cheuksan Edward Wang #50793)

    * ``bzr cat`` can look up contents of removed or renamed files. If the
      pathname is ambiguous, i.e. the files in the old and new trees have
      different id's, the default is the file in the new tree. The user can
      use "--name-from-revision" to select the file in the old tree.
      (Cheuksan Edward Wang, #30190)

  TESTING:

    * TestingHTTPRequestHandler really handles the Range header
      (previously it was ignoring it and returning the whole file,).

Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I'm happy to announce the next release of bzr-svn, version 0.3. The main
focus in this release has been on fixing bugs improving performance.

The following changes have been made:

  BUG FIXES

   * Use checksums for the path in case the file id is too long.
(#77453)

   * Don't rely on listdir() kind results. Fixes imports of several=20
     repositories. (#56647)

   * Fixed two problems with replaces that are nested.

   * Branch downgrades and dir upgrades are now recognized properly
(#67010).

   * Supported branching schemes other that trunk-0.

   * Properly recognize discontinued branches. (#76823)

   * Switched to storing data in SQLite. (#74798)
  =20
   * Locks ra transports. (#76280)

   * Use built-in ra callbacks from Subversion. (#64816)

   * Implement SvnRaTransport.mkdir(). (#65138)

   * Avoid raising SubversionException's for non-subversion
directories.=20

   * Remove requirement for svn+ prefix. (#75751)

   * Don't consider SvnRepositories for writing for regular Bazaar=20
     branches. (#77023)

   * Don't try to import files as branches.

   * Store file id map when committing to Subversion. (#54738)

   * Support spaces in filenames in working trees.

  IMPROVEMENTS

   * Implemented SvnRepository.all_revision_ids().

   * Proper ProgressBars.

   * Made `to_location' argument for svn-import optional.

   * Removed unused code.

   * Several attempts to reduce memory usage.

   * The LogWalker class is now a lot dumber.

   * Added --scheme and --all options to svn-import.

   * Implemented SvnRaTransport.list_dir().

   * Conversion output can now be on a remote transport.

   * Upgrade command can be used to upgrade branches created with=20
     older versions of the plugin.

   * Fail early when unpatched python Subversion bindings are installed.

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

   * More efficient implementation of follow_history().

   * Split out follow_branch_history() of follow_branch().

   * Reduced number of remote listdir calls.

   * Only determine file ids for changed files. Reduces disk usage=20
     significantly.

All Subversion branches should be fetchable without problems now. If you
come across a branch that doesn't work (errors during branch copy or
when back to Subversion), please let me know by filing a bug report.
Bugs can be reported in launchpad:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+filebug

0.3 is available from http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.3.tar.gz
It requires Bazaar 0.14rc1 or later.

Happy hacking!

Cheers,

Jelmer

Hi all,

the first 0.14 release candidate arrives a little less than a week before t=
he
end of the unusual two month release cycle, which should be Monday the 22nd=
 if
all goes well.

Tarballs:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.14rc1.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.14rc1.tar.gz.sig

md5 and sha1 checksums:
e32588e4247726ba92d5708a5e981ec3  bzr-0.14rc1.tar.gz
272029473b2a804d8ac32e070e04ba7e258726d5  bzr-0.14rc1.tar.gz

Release branch:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.0.14

A list of all bugs and features for 0.14 is kept by Launchpad at:
    https://launchpad.net/bzr/+milestone/0.14


This release candidate has several performance and documentation improvemen=
ts,
a different ignore pattern matcher (supporting regular expressions), variab=
le
policies making it easier to apply settings to a hierarchy of branches (see
doc/configuration.text) and a controversial --pull option to merge allowing=
 it
to degenerate into a pull when the branches have not diverged. Let us know =
what
you think of these changes.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! The contents of NEWS f=
or
0.14rc1 are included below.

Wouter van Heyst


bzr 0.14rc1  2007-01-16

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New connection: ``bzr+http://`` which supports tunnelling the smart
      protocol over an HTTP connection. If writing is enabled on the bzr
      server, then you can write over the http connection.
      (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Aliases now support quotation marks, so they can contain whitespace
      (Marius Kruger)

    * PyCurlTransport now use a single curl object. By specifying explicitly
      the 'Range' header, we avoid the need to use two different curl objec=
ts
      (and two connections to the same server). (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``bzr commit`` does not prompt for a message until it is very likely =
to
      succeed.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr conflicts`` now takes --text to list pathnames of text conflicts
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Fix ``iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` to use a set instead
      of a list while checking if a revision id was requested. Takes 10s
      off of the ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` time, which is 10s
      of the ``bzr branch`` time. Also improve ``fileids_...`` time by
      filtering lines with a regex rather than multiple ``str.find()``
      calls. (saves another 300ms) (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Policy can be set for each configuration key. This allows keys to be
      inherited properly across configuration entries. For example, this
      should enable you to do::
       =20
        [/home/user/project]
        push_location =3D sftp://host/srv/project/
        push_location:policy =3D appendpath

      And then a branch like ``/home/user/project/mybranch`` should get an
      automatic push location of ``sftp://host/srv/project/mybranch``.
      (James Henstridge)

    * Added ``bzr status --short`` to make status report svn style flags
      for each file.  For example::

        $ bzr status --short
        A  foo
        A  bar
        D  baz
        ?  wooley

    * 'bzr selftest --clean-output' allows easily clean temporary tests=20
      directories without running tests. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr help hidden-commands`` lists all hidden commands. (Aaron Bentle=
y)

    * ``bzr merge`` now has an option ``--pull`` to fall back to pull if
      local is fully merged into remote. (Jan Hudec)

    * ``bzr help formats`` describes available directory formats. (Aaron Be=
ntley)

  INTERNALS:

    * A few tweaks directly to ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` to
      help speed up processing, as well allowing to extract unannotated
      lines. Between the two ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` is
      improved by approx 10%. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Change Revision serialization to only write out millisecond
      resolution. Rather than expecting floating point serialization to
      preserve more resolution than we need. (Henri Weichers, Martin Pool)

    * Test suite ends cleanly on Windows.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * When 'encoding_type' attribute of class Command is equal to 'exact',=
=20
      force sys.stdout to be a binary stream on Windows, and therefore
      keep exact line-endings (without LF -> CRLF conversion).
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Single-letter short options are no longer globally declared.  (Martin
      Pool)

    * Before using detected user/terminal encoding bzr should check
      that Python has corresponding codec. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Formats for end-user selection are provided via a FormatRegistry (Aar=
on Bentley)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr missing --verbose`` was showing adds/removals in the wrong
      direction. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr annotate`` now defaults to showing dotted revnos for merged
      revisions. It cuts them off at a depth of 12 characters, but you can
      supply ``--long`` to see the full number. You can also use
      ``--show-ids`` to display the original revision ids, rather than
      revision numbers and committer names. (John Arbash Meinel, #75637)

    * bzr now supports Win32 UNC path (e.g. \\HOST\path).=20
      (Alexander Belchenko, #57869)

    * Win32-specific: output of cat, bundle and diff commands don't mangle
      line-endings (Alexander Belchenko, #55276)

    * Replace broken fnmatch based ignore pattern matching with custom patt=
ern
      matcher.
      (Kent Gibson, Jan Hudec #57637)

    * pycurl and urllib can detect short reads at different places. Update
      the test suite to test more cases. Also detect http error code 416
      which was raised for that specific bug. Also enhance the urllib
      robustness by detecting invalid ranges (and pycurl's one by detecting
      short reads during the initial GET). (Vincent Ladeuil, #73948)

    * The urllib connection sharing interacts badly with urllib2
      proxy setting (the connections didn't go thru the proxy
      anymore). Defining a proper ProxyHandler solves the
      problem.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #74759)

    * Use urlutils to generate relative URLs, not osutils=20
      (Aaron Bentley, #76229)

    * ``bzr status`` in a readonly directory should work without giving
      lots of errors. (John Arbash Meinel, #76299)

    * Mention the revisionspec topic for the revision option help.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #31663)

    * Allow plugins import from zip archives.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #68124)

Heavyweight checkouts don't work with bzr-svn yet. See
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bzr/+bug/79330 for details.

I'm currently trying to fix this, see the "[MERGE] Add Branch support to
CommitBuilder" thread for more info.

You should be able to commit ok if you created the branch using "bzr branch=
". What error does it fail with?

I'm pleased to announce the release of bzr 0.14. This release is stable
and suitable for general deployment.

Tarballs:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.14.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.14.tar.gz.sig

md5 and sha1 checksums:
281c777f377cc149b6ba60c720f70033  bzr-0.14.tar.gz
90c6278b332f369585ca6db47b65c4e7c60d6a6f  bzr-0.14.tar.gz

Release branch:
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/bzr/bzr.0.14

A list of all bugs and features for 0.14 is kept by Launchpad at:
    https://launchpad.net/products/bzr/+milestone/0.14


This release candidate has several performance and documentation improvemen=
ts,
a different ignore pattern matcher (supporting regular expressions), variab=
le
policies making it easier to apply settings to a hierarchy of branches (see
doc/configuration.text) and a controversial --pull option to merge allowing=
 it
to degenerate into a pull when the branches have not diverged. Let us know =
what
you think of these changes.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! The contents of NEWS f=
or
0.14rc1 are included below:

bzr 0.14  2007-01-23

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options. (Aaron Bent=
ley)

  BUG FIXES:
   =20
    * Skip documentation generation tests if the tools to do so are not
      available. Fixes running selftest for installled copies of bzr.=20
      (John Arbash Meinel, #80330)

    * Fix the code that discovers whether bzr is being run from it's
      working tree to handle the case when it isn't but the directory
      it is in is below a repository. (James Westby, #77306)

bzr 0.14rc1  2007-01-16

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New connection: ``bzr+http://`` which supports tunnelling the smart
      protocol over an HTTP connection. If writing is enabled on the bzr
      server, then you can write over the http connection.
      (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Aliases now support quotation marks, so they can contain whitespace
      (Marius Kruger)

    * PyCurlTransport now use a single curl object. By specifying explicitly
      the 'Range' header, we avoid the need to use two different curl objec=
ts
      (and two connections to the same server). (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``bzr commit`` does not prompt for a message until it is very likely =
to
      succeed.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr conflicts`` now takes --text to list pathnames of text conflicts
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Fix ``iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` to use a set instead
      of a list while checking if a revision id was requested. Takes 10s
      off of the ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` time, which is 10s
      of the ``bzr branch`` time. Also improve ``fileids_...`` time by
      filtering lines with a regex rather than multiple ``str.find()``
      calls. (saves another 300ms) (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Policy can be set for each configuration key. This allows keys to be
      inherited properly across configuration entries. For example, this
      should enable you to do::
       =20
        [/home/user/project]
        push_location =3D sftp://host/srv/project/
        push_location:policy =3D appendpath

      And then a branch like ``/home/user/project/mybranch`` should get an
      automatic push location of ``sftp://host/srv/project/mybranch``.
      (James Henstridge)

    * Added ``bzr status --short`` to make status report svn style flags
      for each file.  For example::

        $ bzr status --short
        A  foo
        A  bar
        D  baz
        ?  wooley

    * 'bzr selftest --clean-output' allows easily clean temporary tests=20
      directories without running tests. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr help hidden-commands`` lists all hidden commands. (Aaron Bentle=
y)

    * ``bzr merge`` now has an option ``--pull`` to fall back to pull if
      local is fully merged into remote. (Jan Hudec)

    * ``bzr help formats`` describes available directory formats. (Aaron Be=
ntley)

  INTERNALS:

    * A few tweaks directly to ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` to
      help speed up processing, as well allowing to extract unannotated
      lines. Between the two ``fileids_affected_by_revision_ids`` is
      improved by approx 10%. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Change Revision serialization to only write out millisecond
      resolution. Rather than expecting floating point serialization to
      preserve more resolution than we need. (Henri Weichers, Martin Pool)

    * Test suite ends cleanly on Windows.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * When 'encoding_type' attribute of class Command is equal to 'exact',=
=20
      force sys.stdout to be a binary stream on Windows, and therefore
      keep exact line-endings (without LF -> CRLF conversion).
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Single-letter short options are no longer globally declared.  (Martin
      Pool)

    * Before using detected user/terminal encoding bzr should check
      that Python has corresponding codec. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Formats for end-user selection are provided via a FormatRegistry (Aar=
on Bentley)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr missing --verbose`` was showing adds/removals in the wrong
      direction. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr annotate`` now defaults to showing dotted revnos for merged
      revisions. It cuts them off at a depth of 12 characters, but you can
      supply ``--long`` to see the full number. You can also use
      ``--show-ids`` to display the original revision ids, rather than
      revision numbers and committer names. (John Arbash Meinel, #75637)

    * bzr now supports Win32 UNC path (e.g. \\HOST\path).=20
      (Alexander Belchenko, #57869)

    * Win32-specific: output of cat, bundle and diff commands don't mangle
      line-endings (Alexander Belchenko, #55276)

    * Replace broken fnmatch based ignore pattern matching with custom patt=
ern
      matcher.
      (Kent Gibson, Jan Hudec #57637)

    * pycurl and urllib can detect short reads at different places. Update
      the test suite to test more cases. Also detect http error code 416
      which was raised for that specific bug. Also enhance the urllib
      robustness by detecting invalid ranges (and pycurl's one by detecting
      short reads during the initial GET). (Vincent Ladeuil, #73948)

    * The urllib connection sharing interacts badly with urllib2
      proxy setting (the connections didn't go thru the proxy
      anymore). Defining a proper ProxyHandler solves the
      problem.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #74759)

    * Use urlutils to generate relative URLs, not osutils=20
      (Aaron Bentley, #76229)

    * ``bzr status`` in a readonly directory should work without giving
      lots of errors. (John Arbash Meinel, #76299)

    * Mention the revisionspec topic for the revision option help.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #31663)

    * Allow plugins import from zip archives.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #68124)

BzrTools 0.15.0 was based on the wrong version, and lacked the dirstate
compatibility fixes I'd made.  BzrTools 0.15.1 is a brown-paper-bag release.

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.15.x Bazaar series.

I'm happy to announce that Bazaar has reach release candidate 1 for the
0.15 release.=20

Tarballs:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc1.tar.gz
and GPG signature:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc1.tar.gz.sig

In this release we have added a much faster local disk format, initial
support for tags, and nested bzr trees, support for windows 98, many
improvements to the UI, support for paths changing from file to
directory or symlink and vice verca. For full details, see the NEWS
below.

Bazaar 0.15 will be released in approximately 1 weeks time - on or
around the 15th of March.


Many thanks to all the contributors to this release! I've included the
contents of NEWS for 0.15rc1 below:

bzr 0.15rc1  2007-03-07

  SURPRISES:

    * The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
      working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
      operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
      versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use t=
he
      bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-tre=
es
      as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the netwo=
rk.

    * For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working =
tree
      api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, includi=
ng
      the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
      lock_read/lock_write/lock_tree_write has been called, and become inva=
lid
      again after unlock is called. This has been done to improve performan=
ce
      and correctness as part of the dirstate development. (Robert Collins,
      John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

    * For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be conside=
red
      readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute=
, or
      its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
      unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirs=
tate
      format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
      cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by=
 a
      combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
      Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
      saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
      In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn=
't
      exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file ha=
s
      already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target fi=
le
      does exist.
      A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
      exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
      and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
      will only update the Bazaar identifier.
      (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

    * ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
      Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
      uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

    * A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default=20
      directory.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supp=
orts
      "append_history_only" mode, where the log view and revnos do not chan=
ge,
      except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
      ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

    * append_only branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that lo=
g
      view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch usin=
g
      "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descrip=
ed
      in docs/configuration.txt.

    * rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if y=
ou
      "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
      bind location.

    * Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
      stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
      ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned=20
      at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform t=
his
      upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your branch a=
nd
      repositories. (Martin Pool)

    * The bzr:// transport now has a well-known port number, 4155, which it=
 will
      use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-w=
ide
      plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * There is now initial support for managing a forest of trees in bzr,
      and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and finally
      joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iteration
      of this support. To enable the new ``join`` and ``split`` commands,
      please run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working
      trees and repositories. (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

  INTERNALS:

    * Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
      bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
      performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
      revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index=
.
      This will also help with the future dirstate format.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
      versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
      every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks=
,
      all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - 'set_rh',
      'post_push', 'post_pull', 'post_commit', 'post_uncommit'. These hooks
      fire after the matching operation on a branch has taken place, and we=
re
      originally added for the branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
      branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
      level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

    * Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
      trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstat=
e
      tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of=20
      inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
      repository.
      (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * New Branch.last_revision_info method, this is being done to allow
      optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the las=
t
      revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
      formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

    * Allow 'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME' to work when the plugin NAME has n=
ot
      yet been loaded by load_plugins(). This allows plugins to depend on e=
ach
      other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
      gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

    * New Repository method 'gather_stats' for statistic data collection.
      This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
      related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
      ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
      the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

    * Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
      function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
      for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
      to be used more easily. (James Westby)

    * ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
      you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
      to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
      about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  Th=
ese
      are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
      branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

    * Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem=
.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
      Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
      the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

    * Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
      password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
      #83954).

    * ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
      (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

    * Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #8472=
8)

    * Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable (CURL_CA_B=
UNDLE),
      and on win32 along the PATH. (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

    * ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

    * Raise DependencyNotPresent if pycurl do not support https. (Vincent
      Ladeuil, #85305)

    * Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

    * Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
      (Kent Gibson, #86451)

  TESTING:

    * New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
      before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)


    * Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
      (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

I'm happy to announce a second release candidate of Bazaar 0.15.  This
contains several fixes from rc1 and all rc1 users are recommended to
upgrade.  We would very much appreciate if people using 0.14 or
earlier versions would try this candidate and report their results.

I believe this rc still has some problems with the new dirstate
working tree format on Windows, which will need to be fixed before the
final release.  Our goal is to make that release in one week, on the
22nd of March.

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc2.tar.gz

The rc1 announcement is here:

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc2.tar.gz



Here is a list of changes since 0.14:

bzr 0.15rc2  2007-03-14

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * Release 0.15rc2 of bzr changes the ``bzr init-repo`` command to
      default to ``--trees`` instead of ``--no-trees``.
      Existing shared repositories are not affected.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New ``merge-directive`` command to generate machine- and human-readable
      merge requests.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``submit:`` revision specifier makes it easy to diff against the
      common ancestor with the submit location (Aaron Bentley)

    * Added support for Putty's SSH implementation. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Added ``bzr status --versioned`` to report only versioned files,
      not unknowns. (Kent Gibson)

    * Merge now autodetects the correct line-ending style for its conflict
      markers.  (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Refactored SSH vendor registration into SSHVendorManager class.
      (Dmitry Vasiliev)

  BUGFIXES:

    * New ``--numbered-dirs`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to use
      numbered dirs for TestCaseInTempDir. This is default behavior
      on Windows. Anyone can force named dirs on Windows
      with ``--no-numbered-dirs``. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Fix ``RevisionSpec_revid`` to handle the Unicode strings passed in
      from the command line. (Marien Zwart, #90501)

    * Fix ``TreeTransform._iter_changes`` when both the source and
      destination are missing. (Aaron Bentley, #88842)

    * Fix commit of merges with symlinks in dirstate trees.
      (Marien Zwart)

    * Switch the ``bzr init-repo`` default from --no-trees to --trees.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #53483)


bzr 0.15rc1  2007-03-07

  SURPRISES:

    * The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
      working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
      operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
      versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use the
      bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-trees
      as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the network.

    * For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working tree
      api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, including
      the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
      lock_read/lock_write/lock_tree_write has been called, and become invalid
      again after unlock is called. This has been done to improve performance
      and correctness as part of the dirstate development. (Robert Collins,
      John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

    * For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be considered
      readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute, or
      its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
      unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirstate
      format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
      cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by a
      combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
      Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
      saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
      In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn't
      exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file has
      already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target file
      does exist.
      A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
      exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
      and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
      will only update the Bazaar identifier.
      (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

    * ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
      Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
      uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

    * A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default
      directory.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supports
      "append_history_only" mode, where the log view and revnos do not change,
      except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
      ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

    * append_only branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that log
      view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch using
      "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descriped
      in docs/configuration.txt.

    * rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if you
      "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
      bind location.

    * Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
      stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
      ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned
      at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform this
      upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-tags`` in your branch and
      repositories. (Martin Pool)

    * The bzr:// transport now has a well-known port number, 4155, which it will
      use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-wide
      plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
      bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
      performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
      revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index.
      This will also help with the future dirstate format.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
      versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
      every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks,
      all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - 'set_rh',
      'post_push', 'post_pull', 'post_commit', 'post_uncommit'. These hooks
      fire after the matching operation on a branch has taken place, and were
      originally added for the branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
      branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
      level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

    * Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
      trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstate
      tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of
      inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
      repository.
      (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * New Branch.last_revision_info method, this is being done to allow
      optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the last
      revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
      formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

    * Allow 'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME' to work when the plugin NAME has not
      yet been loaded by load_plugins(). This allows plugins to depend on each
      other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
      gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

    * New Repository method 'gather_stats' for statistic data collection.
      This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
      related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
      ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
      the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

    * Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
      function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
      for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
      to be used more easily. (James Westby)

    * ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
      you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
      to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
      about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  These
      are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

    * File formats and architecture is in place for managing a forest of trees
      in bzr, and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and
      finally joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iteration
      of this support, and the user-facing aspects still require substantial
      work.  If you wish to experiment with it, use ``bzr upgrade
      --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working trees and repositories.
      You can use the hidden commands ``split`` and ``join`` and to create
      and manipulate nested trees, but please consider using the nested-trees
      branch, which contains substantial UI improvements, instead.
      http://code.aaronbentley.com/bzr/bzrrepo/nested-trees/
      (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
      branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

    * Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
      Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
      the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

    * Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
      password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
      #83954).

    * ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
      (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

    * Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #84728)

    * Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable
(CURL_CA_BUNDLE),
      and on win32 along the PATH. (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

    * ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

    * Raise DependencyNotPresent if pycurl do not support https. (Vincent
      Ladeuil, #85305)

    * Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

    * Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
      (Kent Gibson, #86451)

    * bzr rocks. It sure does! Fix case. (Vincent Ladeuil, #78026)

    * Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
      (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

  TESTING:

    * New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
      before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)

The Bazaar developers are happy to announce a candidate for the 0.15
release of the Bazaar version control system.  This candidate fixes a
few problems reported in earlier candidates, and will become the 0.15
final release if no serious problems are reported.  Early testing
would be very much appreciated.

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc3.tar.gz

Here are the changes since the last major release:

bzr 0.15rc3  2007-03-26

  CHANGES:

    * A warning is now displayed when opening working trees in older
      formats, to encourage people to upgrade to WorkingTreeFormat4.
      (Martin Pool)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * HTTP redirections are now taken into account when a branch (or a
      bundle) is accessed for the first time. A message is issued at each
      redirection to inform the user. In the past, http redirections were
      silently followed for each request which significantly degraded the
      performances. The http redirections are not followed anymore by
      default, instead a RedirectRequested exception is raised. For bzrlib
      users needing to follow http redirections anyway,
      bzrlib.transport.do_catching_redirections provide an easy transition
      path.
      (vila)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added ``ReadLock.temporary_write_lock()`` to allow upgrading an OS read
      lock to an OS write lock. Linux can do this without unlocking, Win32
      needs to unlock in between. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New parameter ``recommend_upgrade`` to BzrDir.open_workingtree
      to silence (when false) warnings about opening old formats.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor performance regression with bzr-0.15 on pre-dirstate
      trees. (We were reading the working inventory too many times).
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Take smtp_server from user config into account.
      (vila, #92195)

    * Restore Unicode filename handling for versioned and unversioned files.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #92608)

    * Don't fail during ``bzr commit`` if a file is marked removed, and
      the containing directory is auto-removed.  (John Arbash Meinel, #93681)

    * ``bzr status FILENAME`` failed on Windows because of an uncommon
      errno. (``ERROR_DIRECTORY == 267 != ENOTDIR``).
      (Wouter van Heyst, John Arbash Meinel, #90819)

    * ``bzr checkout source`` should create a local branch in the same
      format as source. (John Arbash Meinel, #93854)

    * ``bzr commit`` with a kind change was failing to update the
      last-changed-revision for directories.  The
      InventoryDirectory._unchanged only looked at the parent_id and name,
      ignoring the fact that the kind could have changed, too.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #90111)

    * ``bzr mv dir/subdir other`` was incorrectly updating files inside
      the directory. So that there was a chance it would break commit,
      etc. (John Arbash Meinel, #94037)

    * Correctly handles mutiple permanent http redirections.
     (vila, #88780)


bzr 0.15rc2  2007-03-14

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * Release 0.15rc2 of bzr changes the ``bzr init-repo`` command to
      default to ``--trees`` instead of ``--no-trees``.
      Existing shared repositories are not affected.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New ``merge-directive`` command to generate machine- and human-readable
      merge requests.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``submit:`` revision specifier makes it easy to diff against the
      common ancestor with the submit location (Aaron Bentley)

    * Added support for Putty's SSH implementation. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Added ``bzr status --versioned`` to report only versioned files,
      not unknowns. (Kent Gibson)

    * Merge now autodetects the correct line-ending style for its conflict
      markers.  (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Refactored SSH vendor registration into SSHVendorManager class.
      (Dmitry Vasiliev)

  BUGFIXES:

    * New ``--numbered-dirs`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to use
      numbered dirs for TestCaseInTempDir. This is default behavior
      on Windows. Anyone can force named dirs on Windows
      with ``--no-numbered-dirs``. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Fix ``RevisionSpec_revid`` to handle the Unicode strings passed in
      from the command line. (Marien Zwart, #90501)

    * Fix ``TreeTransform._iter_changes`` when both the source and
      destination are missing. (Aaron Bentley, #88842)

    * Fix commit of merges with symlinks in dirstate trees.
      (Marien Zwart)

    * Switch the ``bzr init-repo`` default from --no-trees to --trees.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #53483)


bzr 0.15rc1  2007-03-07

  SURPRISES:

    * The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
      working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
      operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
      versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use the
      bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-trees
      as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the network.

    * For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working tree
      api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, including
      the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
      lock_read/lock_write/lock_tree_write has been called, and become invalid
      again after unlock is called. This has been done to improve performance
      and correctness as part of the dirstate development. (Robert Collins,
      John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

    * For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be considered
      readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute, or
      its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
      unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirstate
      format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
      cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by a
      combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
      Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
      saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
      In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn't
      exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file has
      already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target file
      does exist.
      A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
      exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
      and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
      will only update the Bazaar identifier.
      (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

    * ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
      Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
      uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

    * A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default
      directory.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supports
      "append_history_only" mode, where the log view and revnos do not change,
      except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
      ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

    * append_only branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that log
      view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch using
      "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descriped
      in docs/configuration.txt.

    * rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if you
      "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
      bind location.

    * Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
      stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
      ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned
      at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform this
      upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-tags`` in your branch and
      repositories. (Martin Pool)

    * The bzr:// transport now has a well-known port number, 4155, which it will
      use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-wide
      plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
      bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
      performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
      revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index.
      This will also help with the future dirstate format.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
      versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
      every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks,
      all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - 'set_rh',
      'post_push', 'post_pull', 'post_commit', 'post_uncommit'. These hooks
      fire after the matching operation on a branch has taken place, and were
      originally added for the branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
      branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
      level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

    * Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
      trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstate
      tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of
      inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
      repository.
      (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * New Branch.last_revision_info method, this is being done to allow
      optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the last
      revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
      formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

    * Allow 'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME' to work when the plugin NAME has not
      yet been loaded by load_plugins(). This allows plugins to depend on each
      other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
      gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

    * New Repository method 'gather_stats' for statistic data collection.
      This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
      related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
      ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
      the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

    * Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
      function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
      for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
      to be used more easily. (James Westby)

    * ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
      you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
      to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
      about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  These
      are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

    * File formats and architecture is in place for managing a forest of trees
      in bzr, and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and
      finally joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iteration
      of this support, and the user-facing aspects still require substantial
      work.  If you wish to experiment with it, use ``bzr upgrade
      --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working trees and repositories.
      You can use the hidden commands ``split`` and ``join`` and to create
      and manipulate nested trees, but please consider using the nested-trees
      branch, which contains substantial UI improvements, instead.
      http://code.aaronbentley.com/bzr/bzrrepo/nested-trees/
      (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
      branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

    * Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
      Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
      the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

    * Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
      password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
      #83954).

    * ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
      (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

    * Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #84728)

    * Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable
(CURL_CA_BUNDLE),
      and on win32 along the PATH. (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

    * ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

    * Raise DependencyNotPresent if pycurl do not support https. (Vincent
      Ladeuil, #85305)

    * Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

    * Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
      (Kent Gibson, #86451)

    * bzr rocks. It sure does! Fix case. (Vincent Ladeuil, #78026)

    * Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
      (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

  TESTING:

    * New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
      before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm chagrined to announce BzrTools 0.15.4

This is a bugfix release that updates the test suite for the new locking
semantics introduced in Bazaar 0.15 RC3.  It is otherwise identical to
0.15.3.

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.15.x Bazaar series.
   Of course, so were all bzrtools 0.15 releases, but bzrlib interface
changes have made that a pipe dream.

BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or frivolous
functionality for bzr.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 0.15.4 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.15.4.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.15.4.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

The Bazaar developers are happy to announce a candidate for the 0.15
release of the Bazaar version control system.  This candidate fixes a
few problems reported in earlier candidates, and will become the 0.15
final release if no serious problems are reported.  Early testing
would be very much appreciated.

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15rc3.tar.gz

167d0fcfc1706eaed9675c4ebbc80d17c8dc0b1b  bzr-0.15rc3.tar.gz

Here are the changes since the last major release:

bzr 0.15rc3  2007-03-26

  CHANGES:

    * A warning is now displayed when opening working trees in older
      formats, to encourage people to upgrade to WorkingTreeFormat4.
      (Martin Pool)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * HTTP redirections are now taken into account when a branch (or a
      bundle) is accessed for the first time. A message is issued at each
      redirection to inform the user. In the past, http redirections were
      silently followed for each request which significantly degraded the
      performances. The http redirections are not followed anymore by
      default, instead a RedirectRequested exception is raised. For bzrlib
      users needing to follow http redirections anyway,
      bzrlib.transport.do_catching_redirections provide an easy transition
      path.
      (vila)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added ``ReadLock.temporary_write_lock()`` to allow upgrading an OS re=
ad
      lock to an OS write lock. Linux can do this without unlocking, Win32
      needs to unlock in between. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New parameter ``recommend_upgrade`` to BzrDir.open_workingtree
      to silence (when false) warnings about opening old formats.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor performance regression with bzr-0.15 on pre-dirstate
      trees. (We were reading the working inventory too many times).
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Take smtp_server from user config into account.
      (vila, #92195)

    * Restore Unicode filename handling for versioned and unversioned files.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #92608)

    * Don't fail during ``bzr commit`` if a file is marked removed, and
      the containing directory is auto-removed.  (John Arbash Meinel, #9368=
1)

    * ``bzr status FILENAME`` failed on Windows because of an uncommon
      errno. (``ERROR_DIRECTORY =3D=3D 267 !=3D ENOTDIR``).
      (Wouter van Heyst, John Arbash Meinel, #90819)

    * ``bzr checkout source`` should create a local branch in the same
      format as source. (John Arbash Meinel, #93854)

    * ``bzr commit`` with a kind change was failing to update the
      last-changed-revision for directories.  The
      InventoryDirectory._unchanged only looked at the parent_id and name,
      ignoring the fact that the kind could have changed, too.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #90111)

    * ``bzr mv dir/subdir other`` was incorrectly updating files inside
      the directory. So that there was a chance it would break commit,
      etc. (John Arbash Meinel, #94037)

    * Correctly handles mutiple permanent http redirections.
     (vila, #88780)


bzr 0.15rc2  2007-03-14

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * Release 0.15rc2 of bzr changes the ``bzr init-repo`` command to
      default to ``--trees`` instead of ``--no-trees``.
      Existing shared repositories are not affected.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New ``merge-directive`` command to generate machine- and human-readab=
le
      merge requests.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``submit:`` revision specifier makes it easy to diff against the
      common ancestor with the submit location (Aaron Bentley)

    * Added support for Putty's SSH implementation. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Added ``bzr status --versioned`` to report only versioned files,
      not unknowns. (Kent Gibson)

    * Merge now autodetects the correct line-ending style for its conflict
      markers.  (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Refactored SSH vendor registration into SSHVendorManager class.
      (Dmitry Vasiliev)

  BUGFIXES:

    * New ``--numbered-dirs`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to use
      numbered dirs for TestCaseInTempDir. This is default behavior
      on Windows. Anyone can force named dirs on Windows
      with ``--no-numbered-dirs``. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Fix ``RevisionSpec_revid`` to handle the Unicode strings passed in
      from the command line. (Marien Zwart, #90501)

    * Fix ``TreeTransform._iter_changes`` when both the source and
      destination are missing. (Aaron Bentley, #88842)

    * Fix commit of merges with symlinks in dirstate trees.
      (Marien Zwart)

    * Switch the ``bzr init-repo`` default from --no-trees to --trees.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #53483)


bzr 0.15rc1  2007-03-07

  SURPRISES:

    * The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
      working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
      operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
      versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use t=
he
      bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-tre=
es
      as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the netwo=
rk.

    * For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working =
tree
      api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, includi=
ng
      the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
      lock_read/lock_write/lock_tree_write has been called, and become inva=
lid
      again after unlock is called. This has been done to improve performan=
ce
      and correctness as part of the dirstate development. (Robert Collins,
      John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

    * For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be conside=
red
      readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute=
, or
      its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
      unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirs=
tate
      format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
      cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by=
 a
      combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
      Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
      saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
      In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn=
't
      exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file has
      already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target fi=
le
      does exist.
      A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
      exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
      and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
      will only update the Bazaar identifier.
      (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

    * ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
      Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
      uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

    * A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default
      directory.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supp=
orts
      "append_history_only" mode, where the log view and revnos do not chan=
ge,
      except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
      ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

    * append_only branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that log
      view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch using
      "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descrip=
ed
      in docs/configuration.txt.

    * rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if y=
ou
      "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
      bind location.

    * Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
      stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
      ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned
      at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform t=
his
      upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-tags`` in your branch and
      repositories. (Martin Pool)

    * The bzr:// transport now has a well-known port number, 4155, which it=
 will
      use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-w=
ide
      plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
      bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
      performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
      revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index.
      This will also help with the future dirstate format.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
      versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
      every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks,
      all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - 'set_rh',
      'post_push', 'post_pull', 'post_commit', 'post_uncommit'. These hooks
      fire after the matching operation on a branch has taken place, and we=
re
      originally added for the branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
      branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
      level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

    * Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
      trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstate
      tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of
      inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
      repository.
      (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * New Branch.last_revision_info method, this is being done to allow
      optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the last
      revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
      formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

    * Allow 'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME' to work when the plugin NAME has n=
ot
      yet been loaded by load_plugins(). This allows plugins to depend on e=
ach
      other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
      gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

    * New Repository method 'gather_stats' for statistic data collection.
      This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
      related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
      ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
      the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

    * Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
      function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
      for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
      to be used more easily. (James Westby)

    * ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
      you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
      to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
      about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  Th=
ese
      are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

    * File formats and architecture is in place for managing a forest of tr=
ees
      in bzr, and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and
      finally joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iterat=
ion
      of this support, and the user-facing aspects still require substantial
      work.  If you wish to experiment with it, use ``bzr upgrade
      --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working trees and repositories.
      You can use the hidden commands ``split`` and ``join`` and to create
      and manipulate nested trees, but please consider using the nested-tre=
es
      branch, which contains substantial UI improvements, instead.
      http://code.aaronbentley.com/bzr/bzrrepo/nested-trees/
      (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
      branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

    * Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
      Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
      the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

    * Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
      password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
      #83954).

    * ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
      (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

    * Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #8472=
8)

    * Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable
(CURL_CA_BUNDLE),
      and on win32 along the PATH. (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

    * ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

    * Raise DependencyNotPresent if pycurl do not support https. (Vincent
      Ladeuil, #85305)

    * Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

    * Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
      (Kent Gibson, #86451)

    * bzr rocks. It sure does! Fix case. (Vincent Ladeuil, #78026)

    * Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
      (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

  TESTING:

    * New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
      before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)

Greeting everybody,

Some changes had to be made on the repository layout hosting the deb
packages of bzr and friends on http://bazaar-vcs.org.  People using this
repository to get their bzr fix will need to update their
/etc/apt/sources.list as follow.

For Ubuntu 6.06 aka "dapper" users, the correct sources.list entry is now=
:

    deb http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/dapper ./
    deb-src http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/dapper ./


For Ubuntu 6.10 aka "edgy" users, the correct sources.list entry is now:

    deb http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/edgy ./
    deb-src http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/edgy ./


Fearless users of the current Ubuntu development branch, Ubuntu 7.04 aka
"feisty", can get the very latest in bzr goodness right from the Ubuntu
archive, as bzr is currently up-to-date in this release.  However, after
the official launch of feisty on April 19th, new updated packages of bzr
and friends will be made available at the following (currently empty)
repository :

    deb http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/feisty ./
    deb-src http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/debs/feisty ./


I sincerely apologize for inconvenience caused by this reorganisation.
Comments and suggestion are welcomed by email, or catch me via IRC in
#bzr on Freenode where I lurk as EtienneG.


Your friendly maintainer,

--=20

The Bazaar version control system developers are happy to announce the
release of bzr 0.15.

   http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.15.tar.gz

   6512ced21dc26fba0915c50697f74e17  bzr-0.15.tar.gz

This release contains many improvements since the last stable release,
including:

 * A much faster working directory format.  This is the default format
for new checkouts and branches; existing working directories can be
upgraded in place with ''bzr upgrade --dirstate''.

 * Built-in support for tags (symbolic names for revisions).  Tags can
be enabled by passing the --dirstate-tags option to the upgrade or
init commands.

 * Format support for tree references, where bzr records references to
independently developed trees.  This is accessible through the
dirstate-subtree branch format, but is only recommended for
experimentation, not production use in this release.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release!  Bug reports,
questions and suggestions are always welcome, to
bazaar@lists.canonical.com, or on #bzr on irc.freenode.net.

bzr 0.15 2007-04-01

  BUGFIXES:

    * Handle incompatible repositories as a user issue when fetching.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Don't give a recommendation to upgrade when branching or
      checking out a branch that contains an old-format working tree.
      (Martin Pool)

bzr 0.15rc3  2007-03-26

  CHANGES:

    * A warning is now displayed when opening working trees in older
      formats, to encourage people to upgrade to WorkingTreeFormat4.
      (Martin Pool)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * HTTP redirections are now taken into account when a branch (or a
      bundle) is accessed for the first time. A message is issued at each
      redirection to inform the user. In the past, http redirections were
      silently followed for each request which significantly degraded the
      performances. The http redirections are not followed anymore by
      default, instead a RedirectRequested exception is raised. For bzrlib
      users needing to follow http redirections anyway,
      bzrlib.transport.do_catching_redirections provide an easy transition
      path.  (vila)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added ``ReadLock.temporary_write_lock()`` to allow upgrading an OS read
      lock to an OS write lock. Linux can do this without unlocking, Win32
      needs to unlock in between. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New parameter ``recommend_upgrade`` to BzrDir.open_workingtree
      to silence (when false) warnings about opening old formats.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Fix minor performance regression with bzr-0.15 on pre-dirstate
      trees. (We were reading the working inventory too many times).
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Take smtp_server from user config into account.
      (vila, #92195)

    * Restore Unicode filename handling for versioned and unversioned files.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #92608)

    * Don't fail during ``bzr commit`` if a file is marked removed, and
      the containing directory is auto-removed.  (John Arbash Meinel, #93681)

    * ``bzr status FILENAME`` failed on Windows because of an uncommon
      errno. (``ERROR_DIRECTORY == 267 != ENOTDIR``).
      (Wouter van Heyst, John Arbash Meinel, #90819)

    * ``bzr checkout source`` should create a local branch in the same
      format as source. (John Arbash Meinel, #93854)

    * ``bzr commit`` with a kind change was failing to update the
      last-changed-revision for directories.  The
      InventoryDirectory._unchanged only looked at the parent_id and name,
      ignoring the fact that the kind could have changed, too.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #90111)

    * ``bzr mv dir/subdir other`` was incorrectly updating files inside
      the directory. So that there was a chance it would break commit,
      etc. (John Arbash Meinel, #94037)

    * Correctly handles mutiple permanent http redirections.
     (vila, #88780)


bzr 0.15rc2  2007-03-14

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * Release 0.15rc2 of bzr changes the ``bzr init-repo`` command to
      default to ``--trees`` instead of ``--no-trees``.
      Existing shared repositories are not affected.

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * New ``merge-directive`` command to generate machine- and human-readable
      merge requests.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``submit:`` revision specifier makes it easy to diff against the
      common ancestor with the submit location (Aaron Bentley)

    * Added support for Putty's SSH implementation. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Added ``bzr status --versioned`` to report only versioned files,
      not unknowns. (Kent Gibson)

    * Merge now autodetects the correct line-ending style for its conflict
      markers.  (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Refactored SSH vendor registration into SSHVendorManager class.
      (Dmitry Vasiliev)

  BUGFIXES:

    * New ``--numbered-dirs`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to use
      numbered dirs for TestCaseInTempDir. This is default behavior
      on Windows. Anyone can force named dirs on Windows
      with ``--no-numbered-dirs``. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Fix ``RevisionSpec_revid`` to handle the Unicode strings passed in
      from the command line. (Marien Zwart, #90501)

    * Fix ``TreeTransform._iter_changes`` when both the source and
      destination are missing. (Aaron Bentley, #88842)

    * Fix commit of merges with symlinks in dirstate trees.
      (Marien Zwart)

    * Switch the ``bzr init-repo`` default from --no-trees to --trees.
      (Wouter van Heyst, #53483)


bzr 0.15rc1  2007-03-07

  SURPRISES:

    * The default disk format has changed. Please run 'bzr upgrade' in your
      working trees to upgrade. This new default is compatible for network
      operations, but not for local operations. That is, if you have two
      versions of bzr installed locally, after upgrading you can only use the
      bzr 0.15 version. This new default does not enable tags or nested-trees
      as they are incompatible with bzr versions before 0.15 over the network.

    * For users of bzrlib: Two major changes have been made to the working tree
      api in bzrlib. The first is that many methods and attributes, including
      the inventory attribute, are no longer valid for use until one of
      lock_read/lock_write/lock_tree_write has been called, and become invalid
      again after unlock is called. This has been done to improve performance
      and correctness as part of the dirstate development. (Robert Collins,
      John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

    * For users of bzrlib: The attribute 'tree.inventory' should be considered
      readonly. Previously it was possible to directly alter this attribute, or
      its contents, and have the tree notice this. This has been made
      unsupported - it may work in some tree formats, but in the newer dirstate
      format such actions will have no effect and will be ignored, or even
      cause assertions. All operations possible can still be carried out by a
      combination of the tree API, and the bzrlib.transform API. (Robert
      Collins, John A Meinel, Martin Pool, and others).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Support for OS Windows 98. Also .bzr.log on any windows system
      saved in My Documents folder. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr mv`` enhanced to support already moved files.
      In the past the mv command would have failed if the source file doesn't
      exist. In this situation ``bzr mv`` would now detect that the file has
      already moved and update the repository accordingly, if the target file
      does exist.
      A new option ``--after`` has been added so that if two files already
      exist, you could notify Bazaar that you have moved a (versioned) file
      and replaced it with another. Thus in this case ``bzr move --after``
      will only update the Bazaar identifier.
      (Steffen Eichenberg, Marius Kruger)

    * ``ls`` now works on treeless branches and remote branches.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help global-options`` describes the global options.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr pull --overwrite`` will now correctly overwrite checkouts.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Files are now allowed to change kind (e.g. from file to symlink).
      Supported by ``commit``, ``revert`` and ``status``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``inventory`` and ``unknowns`` hidden in favour of ``ls``
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr help checkouts`` descibes what checkouts are and some possible
      uses of them. (James Westby, Aaron Bentley)

    * A new ``-d`` option to push, pull and merge overrides the default
      directory.  (Martin Pool)

    * Branch format 6: smaller, and potentially faster than format 5.  Supports
      "append_history_only" mode, where the log view and revnos do not change,
      except by being added to.  Stores policy settings in
      ".bzr/branch/branch.conf".

    * append_only branches:  Format 6 branches may be configured so that log
      view and revnos are always consistent.  Either create the branch using
      "bzr init --append-revisions-only" or edit the config file as descriped
      in docs/configuration.txt.

    * rebind: Format 6 branches retain the last-used bind location, so if you
      "bzr unbind", you can "bzr bind" to bind to the previously-selected
      bind location.

    * Builtin tags support, created and deleted by the ``tag`` command and
      stored in the branch.  Tags can be accessed with the revisionspec
      ``-rtag:``, and listed with ``bzr tags``.  Tags are not versioned
      at present. Tags require a network incompatible upgrade. To perform this
      upgrade, run ``bzr upgrade --dirstate-tags`` in your branch and
      repositories. (Martin Pool)

    * The bzr:// transport now has a well-known port number, 4155, which it will
      use by default.  (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Bazaar now looks for user-installed plugins before looking for site-wide
      plugins. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr resolve`` now detects and marks resolved text conflicts.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * Internally revision ids and file ids are now passed around as utf-8
      bytestrings, rather than treating them as Unicode strings. This has
      performance benefits for Knits, since we no longer need to decode the
      revision id for each line of content, nor for each entry in the index.
      This will also help with the future dirstate format.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Reserved ids (any revision-id ending in a colon) are rejected by
      versionedfiles, repositories, branches, and working trees
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Minor performance improvement by not creating a ProgressBar for
      every KnitIndex we create. (about 90ms for a bzr.dev tree)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New easier to use Branch hooks facility. There are five initial hooks,
      all documented in bzrlib.branch.BranchHooks.__init__ - 'set_rh',
      'post_push', 'post_pull', 'post_commit', 'post_uncommit'. These hooks
      fire after the matching operation on a branch has taken place, and were
      originally added for the branchrss plugin. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``Branch.push()`` which should be used when pushing from a
      branch as it makes performance and policy decisions to match the UI
      level command ``push``. (Robert Collins).

    * Add a new method ``Tree.revision_tree`` which allows access to cached
      trees for arbitrary revisions. This allows the in development dirstate
      tree format to provide access to the callers to cached copies of
      inventory data which are cheaper to access than inventories from the
      repository.
      (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * New Branch.last_revision_info method, this is being done to allow
      optimization of requests for both the number of revisions and the last
      revision of a branch with smartservers and potentially future branch
      formats. (Wouter van Heyst, Robert Collins)

    * Allow 'import bzrlib.plugins.NAME' to work when the plugin NAME has not
      yet been loaded by load_plugins(). This allows plugins to depend on each
      other for code reuse without requiring users to perform file-renaming
      gymnastics. (Robert Collins)

    * New Repository method 'gather_stats' for statistic data collection.
      This is expected to grow to cover a number of related uses mainly
      related to bzr info. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters are now managed with a registry.
      ``log.register_formatter`` continues to work, but callers accessing
      the FORMATTERS dictionary directly will not.

    * Allow a start message to be passed to the ``edit_commit_message``
      function.  This will be placed in the message offered to the user
      for editing above the separator. It allows a template commit message
      to be used more easily. (James Westby)

    * ``GPGStrategy.sign()`` will now raise ``BzrBadParameterUnicode`` if
      you pass a Unicode string rather than an 8-bit string. Callers need
      to be updated to encode first. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch.push, pull, merge now return Result objects with information
      about what happened, rather than a scattering of various methods.  These
      are also passed to the post hooks.  (Martin Pool)

    * File formats and architecture is in place for managing a forest of trees
      in bzr, and splitting up existing trees into smaller subtrees, and
      finally joining trees to make a larger tree. This is the first iteration
      of this support, and the user-facing aspects still require substantial
      work.  If you wish to experiment with it, use ``bzr upgrade
      --dirstate-with-subtree`` in your working trees and repositories.
      You can use the hidden commands ``split`` and ``join`` and to create
      and manipulate nested trees, but please consider using the nested-trees
      branch, which contains substantial UI improvements, instead.
      http://code.aaronbentley.com/bzr/bzrrepo/nested-trees/
      (Aaron Bentley, Martin Pool, Robert Collins).

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate`` now uses dotted revnos from the viewpoint of the
      branch, rather than the last changed revision of the file.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #82158)

    * Lock operations no longer hang if they encounter a permission problem.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr push`` can resume a push that was canceled before it finished.
      Also, it can push even if the target directory exists if you supply
      the ``--use-existing-dir`` flag.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #30576, #45504)

    * Fix http proxy authentication when user and an optional
      password appears in the ``*_proxy`` vars. (Vincent Ladeuil,
      #83954).

    * ``bzr log branch/file`` works for local treeless branches
      (Aaron Bentley, #84247)

    * Fix problem with UNC paths on Windows 98. (Alexander Belchenko, #84728)

    * Searching location of CA bundle for PyCurl in env variable
(CURL_CA_BUNDLE),
      and on win32 along the PATH. (Alexander Belchenko, #82086)

    * ``bzr init`` works with unicode argument LOCATION.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #85599)

    * Raise DependencyNotPresent if pycurl do not support https. (Vincent
      Ladeuil, #85305)

    * Invalid proxy env variables should not cause a traceback.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87765)

    * Ignore patterns normalised to use '/' path separator.
      (Kent Gibson, #86451)

    * bzr rocks. It sure does! Fix case. (Vincent Ladeuil, #78026)

    * Fix bzrtools shelve command for removed lines beginning with "--"
      (Johan Dahlberg, #75577)

  TESTING:

    * New ``--first`` option to ``bzr selftest`` to run specified tests
      before the rest of the suite.  (Martin Pool)

I'm happy (and a bit relieved) to announce a candidate for Bazaar
0.16.  This feature has many changes and improvements from all our
developers, summarized below.

Source is available at

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.16rc1.tar.gz

Please test this release and report any problems.  If there are no
major problems, this release will be the 0.16 final in approximately a
week from now.

bzr 0.16rc1  2007-04-26

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * ``bzr remove`` and ``bzr rm`` will now remove the working file, if
      it could be recovered again.
      This has been done for consistency with svn and the unix rm command.
      The old ``remove`` behaviour has been retained in the new option
      ``bzr remove --keep``, which will just stop versioning the file,
      but not delete it.
      ``bzr remove --force`` have been added which will always delete the
      files.
      ``bzr remove`` is also more verbose.
      (Marius Kruger, #82602)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Merge directives can now be supplied as input to `merge` and `pull`,
      like bundles can.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Sending the SIGQUIT signal to bzr, which can be done on Unix by
      pressing Control-Backslash, drops bzr into a debugger.  Type `c`
      to continue.  This can be disabled by setting the environment variabl=
e
      BZR_SIGQUIT_PDB=3D0.  (Martin Pool)

    * selftest now supports --list-only to list tests instead of running
      them. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * selftest now supports --exclude PATTERN (or -x PATTERN) to exclude
      tests with names that match that regular expression.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #102679)

    * selftest now supports --randomize SEED to run tests in a random order=
.
      SEED is typically the value 'now' meaning 'use the current time'.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #102686)

    * New option ``--fixes`` to commit, which stores bug fixing annotations=
 as
      revision properties. Built-in support for Launchpad, Debian, Trac and
      Bugzilla bug trackers. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge, Robert Coll=
ins)

    * New API, ``bzrlib.bugtracker.tracker_registry``, for adding support f=
or
      other bug trackers to ``fixes``. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge,
      Robert Collins)

    * ``selftest`` has new short options ``-f`` and ``-1``.  (Martin
      Pool)

    * ``bzrlib.tsort.MergeSorter`` optimizations. Change the inner loop
      into using local variables instead of going through ``self._var``.
      Improves the time to ``merge_sort`` a 10k revision graph by
      approximately 40% (~700->400ms).  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``make docs`` now creates a man page at ``man1/bzr.1`` fixing bug 107=
388.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr help`` now provides cross references to other help topics using
      the _see_also facility on command classes. Likewise the bzr_man
      documentation, and the bzr.1 man page also include this information.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Tags are now included in logs, that use the long log formatter.
      (Erik B=E5gfors, Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr help`` provides a clearer message when a help topic cannot be
      found (fixes bug 107656). (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr help`` now accepts optional prefixes for command help. The help
      for all commands can now be found at ``bzr help commands/COMMANDNAME`=
`
      as well as ``bzr help COMMANDNAME`` (which only works for commands
      where the name is not the same as a more general help topic).
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr help PLUGINNAME`` will now return the module docstring from the
      plugin PLUGINNAME fixing bug 50408. (Robert Collins)

    * New help topic ``urlspec`` which lists the availables transports.
      (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * doc/server.txt updated to document the default bzr:// port (fixes
      #107125) and also update the blurb about the hpss' current status.
      (Robert Collins).

    * ``bzr serve`` now listens on interface 0.0.0.0 by default, making it
      serve out to the local LAN (and anyone in the world that can reach th=
e
      machine running ``bzr serve``. (Robert Collins, #98918)

    * A new smart server protocol version has been added.  It prefixes requ=
ests
      and responses with an explicit version identifier so that future prot=
ocol
      revisions can be dealt with gracefully.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Col=
lins)

    * The bzr protocol version 2 indicates success or failure in every resp=
onse
      without depending on particular commands encoding that consistently,
      allowing future client refactorings to be much more robust about erro=
r
      handling. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The smart protocol over HTTP client has been changed to always post t=
o the
      same .bzr/smart URL under the original location when it can.  This al=
lows
      HTTP servers to only have to pass URLs ending in .bzr/smart to the sm=
art
      server handler, and not arbitrary .bzr/*/smart URLs.  (Andrew Bennett=
s)

    * digest authentication is now supported for proxies and HTTP by the ur=
llib
      based http implementation. Tested against Apache 2.0.55 and Squid
      2.6.5. Basic and digest authentication are handled coherently for HTT=
P
      and proxy: if the user is provided in the url (bzr command line for H=
TTP,
      proxy environment variables for proxies), the password is prompted fo=
r
      (only once). If the password is provided, it is taken into account. O=
nce
      the first authentication is successful, all further authentication
      roundtrips are avoided by preventively setting the right authenticati=
on
      header(s).
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

  INTERNALS:

    * bzrlib API compatability with 0.8 has been dropped, cleaning up some
      code paths. (Robert Collins)

    * Change the format of chroot urls so that they can be safely manipulat=
ed
      by generic url utilities without causing the resulting urls to have
      escaped the chroot. A side effect of this is that creating a chroot
      requires an explicit action using a ChrootServer.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Deprecate Branch.get_root_id() because branches don't have root ids,
      rather than fixing bug #96847.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * WorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta provides a better alternative to
      WorkingTree._write_inventory.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Convenience method TestCase.expectFailure ensures that known failures
      do not silently pass.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Transport.local_abspath now raises NotLocalUrl rather than
      TransportNotPossible. (Martin Pool, Ian Clatworthy)

    * New SmartServer hooks facility. There are two initial hooks documente=
d
      in bzrlib.transport.smart.SmartServerHooks. The two initial hooks all=
ow
      plugins to execute code upon server startup and shutdown.
      (Robert Collins).

    * SmartServer in standalone mode will now close its listening socket
      when it stops, rather than waiting for garbage collection. This prima=
rily
      fixes test suite hangs when a test tries to connect to a shutdown ser=
ver.
      It may also help improve behaviour when dealing with a server running
      on a specific port (rather than dynamically assigned ports).
      (Robert Collins)

    * Move most SmartServer code into a new package, bzrlib/smart.
      bzrlib/transport/remote.py contains just the Transport classes that u=
sed
      to be in bzrlib/transport/smart.py.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * urllib http implementation avoid roundtrips associated with
      401 (and 407) errors once the authentication succeeds.
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

    * urlib http now supports querying the user for a proxy password if
      needed. Realm is shown in the prompt for both HTTP and proxy
      authentication when the user is required to type a password.
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

    * Renamed SmartTransport (and subclasses like SmartTCPTransport) to
      RemoteTransport (and subclasses to RemoteTCPTransport, etc).  This is=
 more
      consistent with its new home in bzrlib/transport/remote.py, and becau=
se
      it's not really a "smart" transport, just one that does file operatio=
ns
      via remote procedure calls.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * The ``lock_write`` method of ``LockableFiles``, ``Repository`` and
      ``Branch`` now accept a ``token`` keyword argument, so that separate
      instances of those objects can share a lock if it has the right token=
.
      (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

    * New method 'get_branch_reference' on 'BzrDir' allows the detection of
      branch references - which the smart server component needs.

    * The Repository API ``make_working_trees`` is now permitted to return
      False when ``set_make_working_trees`` is not implemented - previously
      an unimplemented ``set_make_working_trees`` implied the result True
      from ``make_working_trees``. This has been changed to accomodate the
      smart server, where it does not make sense (at this point) to ever
      make working trees by default. (Robert Collins)

    * Command objects can now declare related help topics by having _see_al=
so
      set to a list of related topic. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.help`` now delegates to the Command class for Command specif=
ic
      help. (Robert Collins)

    * New class 'TransportListRegistry', derived from the Registry class, w=
hich
      simplifies tracking the available Transports. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * New function ``Branch.get_revision_id_to_revno_map`` which will
      return a dictionary mapping revision ids to dotted revnos. Since
      dotted revnos are defined in the context of the branch tip, it makes
      sense to generate them from a ``Branch`` object.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Fix the 'Unprintable error' message display to use the repr of the
      exception that prevented printing the error because the str value
      for it is often not useful in debugging (e.g. KeyError('foo') has a
      str() of 'foo' but a repr of 'KeyError('foo')' which is much more
      useful. (Robert Collins)

    * urlutils.normalize_url now unescapes unreserved characters, such as "=
~".
      (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Don't fail bundle selftest if email has 'two' embedded.
      (#98510, Ian Clatworthy)

    * Remove ``--verbose`` from ``bzr bundle``. It didn't work anyway.
      (Robert Widhopf-Fenk, #98591)

    * Remove ``--basis`` from the checkout/branch commands - it didn't work
      properly and is no longer beneficial. Fixes #53675 and #43486.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Don't produce encoding error when adding duplicate files.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Fix ``bzr log <file>`` so it only logs the revisions that changed
      the file, and does it faster.
      (Kent Gibson, John Arbash Meinel, #51980, #69477)

    * Fix ``InterDirstateTre._iter_changes`` to handle when we come across
      an empty versioned directory, which now has files in it.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #104257)

    * Teach ``common_ancestor`` to shortcut when the tip of one branch is
      inside the ancestry of the other. Saves a lot of graph processing
      (with an ancestry of 16k revisions, ``bzr merge ../already-merged``
      changes from 2m10s to 13s).  (John Arbash Meinel, #103757)

    * Fix ``show_diff_trees`` to handle the case when a file is modified,
      and the containing directory is renamed. (The file path is different
      in this versus base, but it isn't marked as a rename).
      (John Arbash Meinel, #103870)

    * FTP now works even when the FTP server does not support atomic rename=
.
      (Aaron Bentley, #89436)

    * Correct handling in bundles and merge directives of timezones with
      that are not an integer number of hours offset from UTC.  Always
      represent the epoch time in UTC to avoid problems with formatting
      earlier times on win32.  (Martin Pool, Alexander Belchenko, John
      Arbash Meinel)

    * Typo in the help for ``register-branch`` fixed. (Robert Collins, #967=
70)

    * "dirstate" and "dirstate-tags" formats now produce branches compatibl=
e
      with old versions of bzr. (Aaron Bentley, #107168))

    * Handle moving a directory when children have been added, removed,
      and renamed. (John Arbash Meinel, #105479)

    * Don't preventively use basic authentication for proxy before receivin=
g a
      407 error. Otherwise people willing to use other authentication schem=
es
      may expose their password in the clear (or nearly). This add one
      roundtrip in case basic authentication should be used, but plug the
      security hole.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Handle http and proxy digest authentication.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #94034).

  TESTING:

    * Added ``bzrlib.strace.strace`` which will strace a single callable an=
d
      return a StraceResult object which contains just the syscalls involve=
d
      in running it. (Robert Collins)

    * New test method ``reduceLockdirTimeout`` to drop the default (ui-cent=
ric)
      default time down to one suitable for tests. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Add new vfs_transport_factory attribute on tests which provides the
      common vfs backing for both the readonly and readwrite transports.
      This allows the RemoteObject tests to back onto local disk or memory,
      and use the existing transport_server attribute all tests know about
      to be the smart server transport. This in turn allows tests to
      differentiate between 'transport to access the branch', and
      'transport which is a VFS' - which matters in Remote* tests.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The ``make_branch_and_tree`` method for tests will now create a
      lightweight checkout for the tree if the vfs_transport_factory is not
      a LocalURLServer. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Branch implementation tests have been audited to ensure that all urls
      passed to Branch APIs use proper urls, except when local-disk paths
      are intended. This is so that tests correctly access the test transpo=
rt
      which is often not equivalent to local disk in Remote* tests. As part
      of this many tests were adjusted to remove dependencies on local disk
      access.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Mark bzrlib.tests and bzrlib.tests.TestUtil as providing assertFOO he=
lper
      functions by adding a __unittest global attribute. (Robert Collins,
      Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Jonathan Lange)

    * Refactored proxy and authentication handling to simplify the
      implementation of new auth schemes for both http and proxy.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

Due to a number of release critical bugs, we're doing a second release
candidate for bazaar 0.16.

Source is available at

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.16rc2.tar.gz

0.16rc2 adds the following fixes:

bzr 0.16rc2  2007-04-30

  BUGFIXES:

    * Handle the case when you delete a file, and then rename another file
      on top of it. Also handle the case of ``bzr rm --keep foo``. ``bzr
      status`` should show the removed file and an unknown file in its
      place. (John Arbash Meinel, #109993)

    * Bundles properly read and write revision properties that have an
      empty value. And when the value is not ASCII.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #109613)

    * Fix the bzr commit message to be in text mode.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #110901)

    * Also handle when you rename a file and create a file where it used
      to be. (John Arbash Meinel, #110256)

    * ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes`` should not descend into unversioned
      directories. (John Arbash Meinel, #110399)

The Bazaar developers are happy to announce the release of Bazaar
0.16.  This release contains optimizations for speed of both network
and local operations -- initial branch over a high-latency link is now
5x faster, and log, merging of bundles or branches are substantially
faster.  Digest authentication is now supported for http proxies and
servers.  Many other aspects have been improved -- for more details,
see the following list.

One change to the user interface should be noted: 'bzr rm' now removes
the working file if it can safely do so, similar to the command in
Subversion.  If the working file has modified the command will fail
unless the --force or --keep option is given.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed code, bug reports or suggestions.

In the next release, due in approximately one month, we will further
improve local and network performance, documentation, and general ui
cleanups.

The Bazaar source, which works on any machine with Python 2.4 or 2.5,
can be downloaded from

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.16.tar.gz

Please contact us at bazaar@lists.canonical.com or in #bzr on freenode
with any questions, comments or problems.

Windows installers will follow shortly.

bzr 0.16  2007-05-07

  BUGFIXES:

    * Handle when you have 2 directories with similar names, but one has a
      hyphen. (``'abc'`` versus ``'abc-2'``). The WT4._iter_changes
      iterator was using direct comparison and ``'abc/a'`` sorts after
      ``'abc-2'``, but ``('abc', 'a')`` sorts before ``('abc-2',)``.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #111227)

    * Handle when someone renames a file on disk without telling bzr.
      Previously we would report the first file as missing, but not show
      the new unknown file. (John Arbash Meinel, #111288)

    * Avoid error when running hooks after pulling into or pushing from
      a branch bound to a smartserver branch.  (Martin Pool, #111968)

bzr 0.16rc2  2007-04-30

  BUGFIXES:

    * Handle the case when you delete a file, and then rename another file
      on top of it. Also handle the case of ``bzr rm --keep foo``. ``bzr
      status`` should show the removed file and an unknown file in its
      place. (John Arbash Meinel, #109993)

    * Bundles properly read and write revision properties that have an
      empty value. And when the value is not ASCII.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #109613)

    * Fix the bzr commit message to be in text mode.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #110901)

    * Also handle when you rename a file and create a file where it used
      to be. (John Arbash Meinel, #110256)

    * ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes`` should not descend into unversioned
      directories. (John Arbash Meinel, #110399)

bzr 0.16rc1  2007-04-26

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * ``bzr remove`` and ``bzr rm`` will now remove the working file, if
      it could be recovered again.
      This has been done for consistency with svn and the unix rm command.
      The old ``remove`` behaviour has been retained in the new option
      ``bzr remove --keep``, which will just stop versioning the file,
      but not delete it.
      ``bzr remove --force`` have been added which will always delete the
      files.
      ``bzr remove`` is also more verbose.
      (Marius Kruger, #82602)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Merge directives can now be supplied as input to `merge` and `pull`,
      like bundles can.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Sending the SIGQUIT signal to bzr, which can be done on Unix by
      pressing Control-Backslash, drops bzr into a debugger.  Type ``'c'``
      to continue.  This can be disabled by setting the environment variabl=
e
      ``BZR_SIGQUIT_PDB=3D0``.  (Martin Pool)

    * selftest now supports --list-only to list tests instead of running
      them. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * selftest now supports --exclude PATTERN (or -x PATTERN) to exclude
      tests with names that match that regular expression.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #102679)

    * selftest now supports --randomize SEED to run tests in a random order=
.
      SEED is typically the value 'now' meaning 'use the current time'.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #102686)

    * New option ``--fixes`` to commit, which stores bug fixing annotations=
 as
      revision properties. Built-in support for Launchpad, Debian, Trac and
      Bugzilla bug trackers. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge, Robert Coll=
ins)

    * New API, ``bzrlib.bugtracker.tracker_registry``, for adding support f=
or
      other bug trackers to ``fixes``. (Jonathan Lange, James Henstridge,
      Robert Collins)

    * ``selftest`` has new short options ``-f`` and ``-1``.  (Martin
      Pool)

    * ``bzrlib.tsort.MergeSorter`` optimizations. Change the inner loop
      into using local variables instead of going through ``self._var``.
      Improves the time to ``merge_sort`` a 10k revision graph by
      approximately 40% (~700->400ms).  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``make docs`` now creates a man page at ``man1/bzr.1`` fixing bug 107=
388.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr help`` now provides cross references to other help topics using
      the _see_also facility on command classes. Likewise the bzr_man
      documentation, and the bzr.1 man page also include this information.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Tags are now included in logs, that use the long log formatter.
      (Erik B=E5gfors, Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``bzr help`` provides a clearer message when a help topic cannot be
      found. (Robert Collins, #107656)

    * ``bzr help`` now accepts optional prefixes for command help. The help
      for all commands can now be found at ``bzr help commands/COMMANDNAME`=
`
      as well as ``bzr help COMMANDNAME`` (which only works for commands
      where the name is not the same as a more general help topic).
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr help PLUGINNAME`` will now return the module docstring from the
      plugin PLUGINNAME. (Robert Collins, #50408)

    * New help topic ``urlspec`` which lists the availables transports.
      (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * doc/server.txt updated to document the default bzr:// port
      and also update the blurb about the hpss' current status.
      (Robert Collins, #107125).

    * ``bzr serve`` now listens on interface 0.0.0.0 by default, making it
      serve out to the local LAN (and anyone in the world that can reach th=
e
      machine running ``bzr serve``. (Robert Collins, #98918)

    * A new smart server protocol version has been added.  It prefixes requ=
ests
      and responses with an explicit version identifier so that future prot=
ocol
      revisions can be dealt with gracefully.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Col=
lins)

    * The bzr protocol version 2 indicates success or failure in every resp=
onse
      without depending on particular commands encoding that consistently,
      allowing future client refactorings to be much more robust about erro=
r
      handling. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The smart protocol over HTTP client has been changed to always post t=
o the
      same ``.bzr/smart`` URL under the original location when it can.
 This allows
      HTTP servers to only have to pass URLs ending in .bzr/smart to the sm=
art
      server handler, and not arbitrary ``.bzr/*/smart`` URLs.
(Andrew Bennetts)

    * digest authentication is now supported for proxies and HTTP by the ur=
llib
      based http implementation. Tested against Apache 2.0.55 and Squid
      2.6.5. Basic and digest authentication are handled coherently for HTT=
P
      and proxy: if the user is provided in the url (bzr command line for H=
TTP,
      proxy environment variables for proxies), the password is prompted fo=
r
      (only once). If the password is provided, it is taken into account. O=
nce
      the first authentication is successful, all further authentication
      roundtrips are avoided by preventively setting the right authenticati=
on
      header(s).
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

  INTERNALS:

    * bzrlib API compatability with 0.8 has been dropped, cleaning up some
      code paths. (Robert Collins)

    * Change the format of chroot urls so that they can be safely manipulat=
ed
      by generic url utilities without causing the resulting urls to have
      escaped the chroot. A side effect of this is that creating a chroot
      requires an explicit action using a ChrootServer.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Deprecate ``Branch.get_root_id()`` because branches don't have root i=
ds,
      rather than fixing bug #96847.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``WorkingTree.apply_inventory_delta`` provides a better alternative t=
o
      ``WorkingTree._write_inventory``.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Convenience method ``TestCase.expectFailure`` ensures that known fail=
ures
      do not silently pass.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``Transport.local_abspath`` now raises ``NotLocalUrl`` rather than
      ``TransportNotPossible``. (Martin Pool, Ian Clatworthy)

    * New SmartServer hooks facility. There are two initial hooks documente=
d
      in ``bzrlib.transport.smart.SmartServerHooks``. The two initial
hooks allow
      plugins to execute code upon server startup and shutdown.
      (Robert Collins).

    * SmartServer in standalone mode will now close its listening socket
      when it stops, rather than waiting for garbage collection. This prima=
rily
      fixes test suite hangs when a test tries to connect to a shutdown ser=
ver.
      It may also help improve behaviour when dealing with a server running
      on a specific port (rather than dynamically assigned ports).
      (Robert Collins)

    * Move most SmartServer code into a new package, bzrlib/smart.
      bzrlib/transport/remote.py contains just the Transport classes that u=
sed
      to be in bzrlib/transport/smart.py.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * urllib http implementation avoid roundtrips associated with
      401 (and 407) errors once the authentication succeeds.
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

    * urlib http now supports querying the user for a proxy password if
      needed. Realm is shown in the prompt for both HTTP and proxy
      authentication when the user is required to type a password.
      (Vincent Ladeuil).

    * Renamed SmartTransport (and subclasses like SmartTCPTransport) to
      RemoteTransport (and subclasses to RemoteTCPTransport, etc).  This is=
 more
      consistent with its new home in ``bzrlib/transport/remote.py``,
and because
      it's not really a "smart" transport, just one that does file operatio=
ns
      via remote procedure calls.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * The ``lock_write`` method of ``LockableFiles``, ``Repository`` and
      ``Branch`` now accept a ``token`` keyword argument, so that separate
      instances of those objects can share a lock if it has the right token=
.
      (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

    * New method ``get_branch_reference`` on ``BzrDir`` allows the detectio=
n of
      branch references - which the smart server component needs.

    * The Repository API ``make_working_trees`` is now permitted to return
      False when ``set_make_working_trees`` is not implemented - previously
      an unimplemented ``set_make_working_trees`` implied the result True
      from ``make_working_trees``. This has been changed to accomodate the
      smart server, where it does not make sense (at this point) to ever
      make working trees by default. (Robert Collins)

    * Command objects can now declare related help topics by having _see_al=
so
      set to a list of related topic. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.help`` now delegates to the Command class for Command specif=
ic
      help. (Robert Collins)

    * New class ``TransportListRegistry``, derived from the Registry
class, which
      simplifies tracking the available Transports. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

    * New function ``Branch.get_revision_id_to_revno_map`` which will
      return a dictionary mapping revision ids to dotted revnos. Since
      dotted revnos are defined in the context of the branch tip, it makes
      sense to generate them from a ``Branch`` object.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Fix the 'Unprintable error' message display to use the repr of the
      exception that prevented printing the error because the str value
      for it is often not useful in debugging (e.g. KeyError('foo') has a
      str() of 'foo' but a repr of 'KeyError('foo')' which is much more
      useful. (Robert Collins)

    * ``urlutils.normalize_url`` now unescapes unreserved characters,
such as "~".
      (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Don't fail bundle selftest if email has 'two' embedded.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #98510)

    * Remove ``--verbose`` from ``bzr bundle``. It didn't work anyway.
      (Robert Widhopf-Fenk, #98591)

    * Remove ``--basis`` from the checkout/branch commands - it didn't work
      properly and is no longer beneficial.
      (Robert Collins, #53675, #43486)

    * Don't produce encoding error when adding duplicate files.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Fix ``bzr log <file>`` so it only logs the revisions that changed
      the file, and does it faster.
      (Kent Gibson, John Arbash Meinel, #51980, #69477)

    * Fix ``InterDirstateTre._iter_changes`` to handle when we come across
      an empty versioned directory, which now has files in it.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #104257)

    * Teach ``common_ancestor`` to shortcut when the tip of one branch is
      inside the ancestry of the other. Saves a lot of graph processing
      (with an ancestry of 16k revisions, ``bzr merge ../already-merged``
      changes from 2m10s to 13s).  (John Arbash Meinel, #103757)

    * Fix ``show_diff_trees`` to handle the case when a file is modified,
      and the containing directory is renamed. (The file path is different
      in this versus base, but it isn't marked as a rename).
      (John Arbash Meinel, #103870)

    * FTP now works even when the FTP server does not support atomic rename=
.
      (Aaron Bentley, #89436)

    * Correct handling in bundles and merge directives of timezones with
      that are not an integer number of hours offset from UTC.  Always
      represent the epoch time in UTC to avoid problems with formatting
      earlier times on win32.  (Martin Pool, Alexander Belchenko, John
      Arbash Meinel)

    * Typo in the help for ``register-branch`` fixed. (Robert Collins, #967=
70)

    * "dirstate" and "dirstate-tags" formats now produce branches compatibl=
e
      with old versions of bzr. (Aaron Bentley, #107168))

    * Handle moving a directory when children have been added, removed,
      and renamed. (John Arbash Meinel, #105479)

    * Don't preventively use basic authentication for proxy before receivin=
g a
      407 error. Otherwise people willing to use other authentication schem=
es
      may expose their password in the clear (or nearly). This add one
      roundtrip in case basic authentication should be used, but plug the
      security hole.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Handle http and proxy digest authentication.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #94034).

  TESTING:

    * Added ``bzrlib.strace.strace`` which will strace a single callable an=
d
      return a StraceResult object which contains just the syscalls involve=
d
      in running it. (Robert Collins)

    * New test method ``reduceLockdirTimeout`` to drop the default (ui-cent=
ric)
      default time down to one suitable for tests. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Add new ``vfs_transport_factory`` attribute on tests which provides t=
he
      common vfs backing for both the readonly and readwrite transports.
      This allows the RemoteObject tests to back onto local disk or memory,
      and use the existing ``transport_server`` attribute all tests know ab=
out
      to be the smart server transport. This in turn allows tests to
      differentiate between 'transport to access the branch', and
      'transport which is a VFS' - which matters in Remote* tests.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The ``make_branch_and_tree`` method for tests will now create a
      lightweight checkout for the tree if the ``vfs_transport_factory`` is=
 not
      a LocalURLServer. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Branch implementation tests have been audited to ensure that all urls
      passed to Branch APIs use proper urls, except when local-disk paths
      are intended. This is so that tests correctly access the test transpo=
rt
      which is often not equivalent to local disk in Remote* tests. As part
      of this many tests were adjusted to remove dependencies on local disk
      access.
      (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * Mark bzrlib.tests and bzrlib.tests.TestUtil as providing assertFOO he=
lper
      functions by adding a ``__unittest`` global attribute. (Robert Collin=
s,
      Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Jonathan Lange)

    * Refactored proxy and authentication handling to simplify the
      implementation of new auth schemes for both http and proxy.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 0.16.1

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.16.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
A deprecation warning in the help for 'bzr shelf' was fixed, which
apparently fixes bash completion.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 0.16.1 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.16.1.tar.gz

Enjoy!

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * The kind() and is_executable() APIs on the WorkingTree interface no
      longer implicitly (read) locks and unlocks the tree. This *might*
      impact some plug-ins and tools using this part of the API. If you find
      an issue that may be caused by this change, please let us know,
      particularly the plug-in/tool maintainer. If encountered, the API
      fix is to surround kind() and is_executable() calls with lock_read()
      and unlock() like so::

        work_tree.lock_read()
        try:
            kind = work_tree.kind(...)
        finally:
            work_tree.unlock()

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  
    * There are two new help topics, working-trees and repositories that
      attempt to explain these concepts. (James Westby, John Arbash Meinel,
      Aaron Bentley)

    * Added ``bzr log --limit`` to report a limited number of revisions.
      (Kent Gibson, #3659)

    * Revert does not try to preserve file contents that were originally
      produced by reverting to a historical revision.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr log --short`` now includes ``[merge]`` for revisions which
      have more than one parent. This is a small improvement to help
      understanding what changes have occurred
      (John Arbash Meinel, #83887)

    * TreeTransform avoids many renames when contructing large trees,
      improving speed.  3.25x speedups have been observed for construction of
      kernel-sized-trees, and checkouts are 1.28x faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Commit on large trees is now faster. In my environment, a commit of
      a small change to the Mozilla tree (55k files) has dropped from
      66 seconds to 32 seconds. For a small tree of 600 files, commit of a
      small change is 33% faster. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Clean up the ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes()`` internal loops as well as
      ``DirState.update_entry()``. This optimizes the core logic for ``bzr
      diff`` and ``bzr status`` significantly improving the speed of
      both. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The tutorial has been improved. (Matthew Fuller)

    * Better error message for selected file commit of merges. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Updated bash completion. (Antonin 'gree' Komenda)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr push`` should only connect to the remote location one time.
      We have been connecting 3 times because we forget to pass around
      the Transport object. This adds ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport()``, so
      that we can pass in the Transport that we already have.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #75721)

    * ``DirState.set_state_from_inventory()`` needs to properly order
      based on split paths, not just string paths.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #115947)

    * Let TestUIFactoy encode the password prompt with its own stdout.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #110204)

    * pycurl should take use the range header that takes the range hint
      into account.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #112719)

    * WorkingTree4.get_file_sha1 no longer raises an exception when invoked
      on a missing file.  (Aaron Bentley, #118186)

    * WorkingTree.remove works correctly with tree references, and when pwd is
      not the tree root. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Merge no longer fails when a file is renamed in one tree and deleted
      in the other. (Aaron Bentley, #110279)

    * ``revision-info`` now accepts dotted revnos, doesn't require a tree,
      and defaults to the last revision (Matthew Fuller, #90048)

    * Tests no longer fail when BZR_REMOTE_PATH is set in the environment.
      (Daniel Watkins, #111958)

    * ``bzr branch -r revid:foo`` can be used to branch any revision in
      your repository. (Previously Branch6 only supported revisions in your
      mainline). (John Arbash Meinel, #115343)

    * 'branch lp:projname' now creates ./projname as expected.

  INTERNALS:

    * Rework of LogFormatter API to provide beginning/end of log hooks and to
      encapsulate the details of the revision to be logged in a LogRevision
      object.
      In long log formats, merge revision ids are only shown when --show-ids
      is specified, and are labelled "revision-id:", as per mainline
      revisions, instead of "merged:". (Kent Gibson)

    * New ``BranchBuilder`` API which allows the construction of particular
      histories quickly. Useful for testing and potentially other applications
      too. (Robert Collins)

Hi all,

I'm chagrined to announce BzrTools 0.17.1.  It is a brown-paper-bag
release that makes the test suite pass.

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.17.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
Fix test suite breakage due to stripping trailing whitespace.  (Those
trailing whitespaces are sneaky and vengeful!)

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 0.17.1 is available at:

The Bazaar developers are happy to announce the release of Bazaar
0.17.  This release contains around a dozen bug fixes, better
documentation and some incremental performance improvements to status,
diff, commit, branch and checkout. Details are included in the attached
notes.

Note: While the number of bug fixes isn't large in this release, there
are some important dirstate regressions addressed. For this reason, it
is generally advisable to upgrade to this version if you are
encountering any bugs in this area.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed code, bug reports or
suggestions. Please keep them coming!

The Bazaar source, which works on any machine with Python 2.4 or 2.5,
can be downloaded from

 http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.17.tar.gz

Please contact us at bazaar@lists.canonical.com or in #bzr on freenode
with any questions, comments or problems. In particular, note that some
minor changes were made to the API which, in theory, could cause
problems with some plugins, though no such problems have been reported
against the Release Candidates to date. Details on those API changes are
included in the attached notes.

Windows installers will (hopefully) follow shortly.

Enjoy,
Ian C. (on behalf of all the Bazaar developers)

bzr 0.17  2007-06-18

  BUGFIXES:

    * Fix crash of commit due to wrong lookup of filesystem encoding.
      (Colin Watson, #120647)

    * Revert logging just to stderr in commit as broke unicode filenames.
      (Aaron Bentley, Ian Clatworthy, #120930)


bzr 0.17rc1  2007-06-12

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * The kind() and is_executable() APIs on the WorkingTree interface no
      longer implicitly (read) locks and unlocks the tree. This *might*
      impact some plug-ins and tools using this part of the API. If you find
      an issue that may be caused by this change, please let us know,
      particularly the plug-in/tool maintainer. If encountered, the API
      fix is to surround kind() and is_executable() calls with lock_read()
      and unlock() like so::

        work_tree.lock_read()
        try:
            kind = work_tree.kind(...)
        finally:
            work_tree.unlock()

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  
    * There are two new help topics, working-trees and repositories that
      attempt to explain these concepts. (James Westby, John Arbash Meinel,
      Aaron Bentley)

    * Added ``bzr log --limit`` to report a limited number of revisions.
      (Kent Gibson, #3659)

    * Revert does not try to preserve file contents that were originally
      produced by reverting to a historical revision.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr log --short`` now includes ``[merge]`` for revisions which
      have more than one parent. This is a small improvement to help
      understanding what changes have occurred
      (John Arbash Meinel, #83887)

    * TreeTransform avoids many renames when contructing large trees,
      improving speed.  3.25x speedups have been observed for construction of
      kernel-sized-trees, and checkouts are 1.28x faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Commit on large trees is now faster. In my environment, a commit of
      a small change to the Mozilla tree (55k files) has dropped from
      66 seconds to 32 seconds. For a small tree of 600 files, commit of a
      small change is 33% faster. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Clean up the ``WorkingTree4._iter_changes()`` internal loops as well as
      ``DirState.update_entry()``. This optimizes the core logic for ``bzr
      diff`` and ``bzr status`` significantly improving the speed of
      both. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The tutorial has been improved. (Matthew Fuller)

    * Better error message for selected file commit of merges. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Updated bash completion. (Antonin 'gree' Komenda)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr push`` should only connect to the remote location one time.
      We have been connecting 3 times because we forget to pass around
      the Transport object. This adds ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport()``, so
      that we can pass in the Transport that we already have.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #75721)

    * ``DirState.set_state_from_inventory()`` needs to properly order
      based on split paths, not just string paths.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #115947)

    * Let TestUIFactoy encode the password prompt with its own stdout.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #110204)

    * pycurl should take use the range header that takes the range hint
      into account.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #112719)

    * WorkingTree4.get_file_sha1 no longer raises an exception when invoked
      on a missing file.  (Aaron Bentley, #118186)

    * WorkingTree.remove works correctly with tree references, and when pwd is
      not the tree root. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Merge no longer fails when a file is renamed in one tree and deleted
      in the other. (Aaron Bentley, #110279)

    * ``revision-info`` now accepts dotted revnos, doesn't require a tree,
      and defaults to the last revision (Matthew Fuller, #90048)

    * Tests no longer fail when BZR_REMOTE_PATH is set in the environment.
      (Daniel Watkins, #111958)

    * ``bzr branch -r revid:foo`` can be used to branch any revision in
      your repository. (Previously Branch6 only supported revisions in your
      mainline). (John Arbash Meinel, #115343)

    * 'branch lp:projname' now creates ./projname as expected.

  INTERNALS:

    * Rework of LogFormatter API to provide beginning/end of log hooks and to
      encapsulate the details of the revision to be logged in a LogRevision
      object.
      In long log formats, merge revision ids are only shown when --show-ids
      is specified, and are labelled "revision-id:", as per mainline
      revisions, instead of "merged:". (Kent Gibson)

    * New ``BranchBuilder`` API which allows the construction of particular
      histories quickly. Useful for testing and potentially other applications
      too. (Robert Collins)

There will be a Bazaar sprint after Europython in Vilnius:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/EuroPython2007/BazaarSprint

I don't believe that you need to attend to Europython to attend the
sprint, but I may be wrong :).

I realise this is short notice - its two weeks away, but I hope that
anyone in Europe who has the time can make it - with all the planning
out of the way we should be able to get some serious code cutting done!

I'm happy to announce Release Candidate 1 for Bazaar 0.18.
This release provides over 50 changes including:

* 15 bug fixes
* 16 user visible improvements
* 20+ enhancements to internals such as test suite enhancements,
  cleaner APIs and much more developer documentation.

Some of the highlights include better criss-cross merging, improved
usability, faster bundle, merge, missing, pull, update and info operations.

The source is available here:

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.18rc1.tar.gz

The GPG signature is available here:

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.18rc1.tar.gz.sig

Please test this release and report any problems.  If there are no
major problems, this release will become 0.18 final on or around the
target release date of 17-Jul-2007.

I've attached a summary of the changes in 0.18rc1, based on NEWS.

bzr 0.18rc1  2007-07-10

  BUGFIXES:

    * Do not suppress pipe errors, etc. in non-display commands
      (Alexander Belchenko, #87178)

    * Display a useful error message when the user requests to annotate
      a file that is not present in the specified revision.
      (James Westby, #122656)

    * Commands that use status flags now have a reference to 'help
      status-flags'.  (Daniel Watkins, #113436)

    * Work around python-2.4.1 inhability to correctly parse the
      authentication header.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #121889)

    * Use exact encoding for merge directives. (Adeodato Sim, #120591)

    * Fix tempfile permissions error in smart server tar bundling under
      Windows. (Martin_, #119330)

    * Fix detection of directory entries in the inventory. (James Westby)

    * Fix handling of http code 400: Bad Request When issuing too many ranges.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #115209)

    * Issue a CONNECT request when connecting to an https server
      via a proxy to enable SSL tunneling.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #120678)

    * Fix ``bzr log -r`` to support selecting merge revisions, both 
      individually and as part of revision ranges.
      (Kent Gibson, #4663)
 
    * Don't leave cruft behind when failing to acquire a lockdir.
      (Martin Pool, #109169)

    * Don't use the '-f' strace option during tests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #102019).

    * Warn when setting ``push_location`` to a value that will be masked by
      locations.conf.  (Aaron Bentley, #122286)

    * Fix commit ordering in corner case (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

    *  Make annotate behave in a non-ASCII world (Adeodato Sim).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * The --lsprof-file option now dumps a text rendering of the profiling
      information if the filename ends in ".txt". It will also convert the
      profiling information to a format suitable for KCacheGrind if the
      output filename ends in ".callgrind". Fixes to the lsprofcalltree
      conversion process by Jean Paul Calderone and Itamar were also merged.
      See http://ddaa.net/blog/python/lsprof-calltree. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``info`` now defaults to non-verbose mode, displaying only paths and
      abbreviated format info.  ``info -v`` displays all the information
      formerly displayed by ``info``.  (Aaron Bentley, Adeodato Sim)

    * ``bzr missing`` now has better option names ``--this`` and ``--other``.
      (Elliot Murphy)

    * The internal ``weave-list`` command has become ``versionedfile-list``,
      and now lists knits as well as weaves.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Automatic merge base selection uses a faster algorithm that chooses
      better bases in criss-cross merge situations (Aaron Bentley)

    * Progress reporting in ``commit`` has been improved. The various logical
      stages are now reported on as follows, namely:

      * Collecting changes [Entry x/y] - Stage n/m
      * Saving data locally - Stage n/m
      * Uploading data to master branch - Stage n/m
      * Updating the working tree - Stage n/m
      * Running post commit hooks - Stage n/m
      
      If there is no master branch, the 3rd stage is omitted and the total
      number of stages is adjusted accordingly.

      Each hook that is run after commit is listed with a name (as hooks
      can be slow it is useful feedback).
      (Ian Clatworthy, Robert Collins)

    * Various operations that are now faster due to avoiding unnecessary
      topological sorts. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Make merge directives robust against broken bundles. (Aaron Bentley)

    * The lsprof filename note is emitted via trace.note(), not standard
      output.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzrlib`` now exports explicit API compatibility information to assist
      library users and plugins. See the ``bzrlib.api`` module for details.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Remove unnecessary lock probes when acquiring a lockdir.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr --version`` now shows the location of the bzr log file, which
      is especially useful on Windows.  (Martin Pool)

    * -D now supports hooks to get debug tracing of hooks (though its currently
      minimal in nature). (Robert Collins)

    * Long log format reports deltas on merge revisions. 
      (John Arbash Meinel, Kent Gibson)

    * Make initial push over ftp more resilient. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Print a summary of changes for update just like pull does.
      (Daniel Watkins, #113990)

    * Add a -Dhpss option to trace smart protocol requests and responses.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

  LIBRARY API BREAKS:

    * Testing cleanups - 
     ``bzrlib.repository.RepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations``;
      ``bzrlib.repository.InterRepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.interrepository_implementations``;
      ``bzrlib.transport.TransportTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to 
      ``bzrlib.tests.test_transport_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.branch.BranchTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to

      ``bzrlib.versionedfile.InterVersionedFileTestProviderAdapter`` has moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.interversionedfile_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.store.revision.RevisionStoreTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
      ``bzrlib.tests.revisionstore_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.workingtree.WorkingTreeTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
      ``bzrlib.tests.workingtree_implementations``.
      These changes are an API break in the testing infrastructure only.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Relocate TestCaseWithRepository to be more central. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_tree`` will no longer perform glob expansion on
      win32. Callers of the function should do this and use the new
      ``MutableTree.smart_add`` method instead. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.add.glob_expand_for_win32`` is now
      ``bzrlib.win32utils.glob_expand``.  (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.add.FastPath`` is now private and moved to 
      ``bzrlib.mutabletree._FastPath``. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

    * ``LockDir.wait`` removed.  (Martin Pool)

    * The ``SmartServer`` hooks API has changed for the ``server_started`` and
      ``server_stopped`` hooks. The first parameter is now an iterable of
      backing URLs rather than a single URL. This is to reflect that many
      URLs may map to the external URL of the server. E.g. the server interally
      may have a chrooted URL but also the local file:// URL will be at the 
      same location. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * New SMTPConnection class to unify email handling.  (Adeodato Sim)

    * Fix documentation of BzrError. (Adeodato Sim)

    * Make BzrBadParameter an internal error. (Adeodato Sim)

    * Remove use of 'assert False' to raise an exception unconditionally.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Give a cleaner error when failing to decode knit index entry.
      (Martin Pool)

    * TreeConfig would mistakenly search the top level when asked for options
      from a section. It now respects the section argument and only
      searches the specified section. (James Westby)

    * Improve ``make api-docs`` output. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Use os.lstat rather than os.stat for osutils.make_readonly and
      osutils.make_writeable. This makes the difftools plugin more
      robust when dangling symlinks are found. (Elliot Murphy)

    * New ``-Dlock`` option to log (to ~/.bzr.log) information on when 
      lockdirs are taken or released.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzrlib`` Hooks are now nameable using ``Hooks.name_hook``. This 
      allows a nicer UI when hooks are running as the current hook can
      be displayed. (Robert Collins)

    * ``Transport.get`` has had its interface made more clear for ease of use.
      Retrieval of a directory must now fail with either 'PathError' at open
      time, or raise 'ReadError' on a read. (Robert Collins)

    * New method ``_maybe_expand_globs`` on the ``Command`` class for 
      dealing with unexpanded glob lists - e.g. on the win32 platform. This
      was moved from ``bzrlib.add._prepare_file_list``. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.add.smart_add`` and ``bzrlib.add.smart_add_tree`` are now
      deprecated in favour of ``MutableTree.smart_add``. (Robert Collins,
      Martin Pool)

    * New method ``external_url`` on Transport for obtaining the url to
      hand to external processes. (Robert Collins)

    * Teach windows installers to build pyrex/C extensions.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

  TESTING:

    * Removed the ``--keep-output`` option from selftest and clean up test
      directories as they're used.  This reduces the IO load from 
      running the test suite and cuts the time by about half.
      (Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

    * Add scenarios as a public attribute on the TestAdapter classes to allow
      modification of the generated scenarios before adaption and easier
      testing. (Robert Collins)

    * New testing support class ``TestScenarioApplier`` which multiplies
      out a single teste by a list of supplied scenarios. (RobertCollins)

    * Setting ``repository_to_test_repository`` on a repository_implementations
      test will cause it to be called during repository creation, allowing the
      testing of repository classes which are not based around the Format
      concept. For example a repository adapter can be tested in this manner,
      by altering the repository scenarios to include a scenario that sets this
      attribute during the test parameterisation in
      ``bzrlib.tests.repository.repository_implementations``. (Robert Collins)

    * Clean up many of the APIs for blackbox testing of Bazaar.  The standard 
      interface is now self.run_bzr.  The command to run can be passed as
      either a list of parameters, a string containing the command line, or
      (deprecated) varargs parameters.  (Martin Pool)

    * The base TestCase now isolates tests from -D parameters by clearing
      ``debug.debug_flags`` and restores it afterwards. (Robert Collins)

    * Add a relpath parameter to get_transport methods in test framework to
      avoid useless cloning.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #110448)

The Bazaar developers are happy to announce the release of Bazaar
0.18.  This release provides over 50 changes including:

* 15 bug fixes
* 16 user visible improvements
* 20+ enhancements to internals such as test suite enhancements,
  cleaner APIs and much more developer documentation.

Some of the highlights include better criss-cross merging, improved
usability, faster bundle, merge, missing, pull, update and info
operations. Details are included in the attached notes.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed code, bug reports or
suggestions. Please keep them coming!

The Bazaar source, which works on any machine with Python 2.4 or 2.5,
can be downloaded from

 http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.18.tar.gz

Please contact us at bazaar@lists.canonical.com or in #bzr on freenode
with any questions, comments or problems.

Windows installers will follow shortly.

Enjoy,
Ian C. (on behalf of all the Bazaar developers)

PS: Thanks to everyone who tested the Release Candidate. FWIW, only a
single change - file globbing on win32 for add - has been made since
then for this release.

bzr 0.18  2007-07-17

  BUGFIXES:

    * Fix 'bzr add' crash under Win32 (Kuno Meyer)


bzr 0.18rc1  2007-07-10

  BUGFIXES:

    * Do not suppress pipe errors, etc. in non-display commands
      (Alexander Belchenko, #87178)

    * Display a useful error message when the user requests to annotate
      a file that is not present in the specified revision.
      (James Westby, #122656)

    * Commands that use status flags now have a reference to 'help
      status-flags'.  (Daniel Watkins, #113436)

    * Work around python-2.4.1 inhability to correctly parse the
      authentication header.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #121889)

    * Use exact encoding for merge directives. (Adeodato Sim, #120591)

    * Fix tempfile permissions error in smart server tar bundling under
      Windows. (Martin_, #119330)

    * Fix detection of directory entries in the inventory. (James Westby)

    * Fix handling of http code 400: Bad Request When issuing too many ranges.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #115209)

    * Issue a CONNECT request when connecting to an https server
      via a proxy to enable SSL tunneling.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #120678)

    * Fix ``bzr log -r`` to support selecting merge revisions, both 
      individually and as part of revision ranges.
      (Kent Gibson, #4663)
 
    * Don't leave cruft behind when failing to acquire a lockdir.
      (Martin Pool, #109169)

    * Don't use the '-f' strace option during tests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #102019).

    * Warn when setting ``push_location`` to a value that will be masked by
      locations.conf.  (Aaron Bentley, #122286)

    * Fix commit ordering in corner case (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

    *  Make annotate behave in a non-ASCII world (Adeodato Sim).

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * The --lsprof-file option now dumps a text rendering of the profiling
      information if the filename ends in ".txt". It will also convert the
      profiling information to a format suitable for KCacheGrind if the
      output filename ends in ".callgrind". Fixes to the lsprofcalltree
      conversion process by Jean Paul Calderone and Itamar were also merged.
      See http://ddaa.net/blog/python/lsprof-calltree. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``info`` now defaults to non-verbose mode, displaying only paths and
      abbreviated format info.  ``info -v`` displays all the information
      formerly displayed by ``info``.  (Aaron Bentley, Adeodato Sim)

    * ``bzr missing`` now has better option names ``--this`` and ``--other``.
      (Elliot Murphy)

    * The internal ``weave-list`` command has become ``versionedfile-list``,
      and now lists knits as well as weaves.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Automatic merge base selection uses a faster algorithm that chooses
      better bases in criss-cross merge situations (Aaron Bentley)

    * Progress reporting in ``commit`` has been improved. The various logical
      stages are now reported on as follows, namely:

      * Collecting changes [Entry x/y] - Stage n/m
      * Saving data locally - Stage n/m
      * Uploading data to master branch - Stage n/m
      * Updating the working tree - Stage n/m
      * Running post commit hooks - Stage n/m
      
      If there is no master branch, the 3rd stage is omitted and the total
      number of stages is adjusted accordingly.

      Each hook that is run after commit is listed with a name (as hooks
      can be slow it is useful feedback).
      (Ian Clatworthy, Robert Collins)

    * Various operations that are now faster due to avoiding unnecessary
      topological sorts. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Make merge directives robust against broken bundles. (Aaron Bentley)

    * The lsprof filename note is emitted via trace.note(), not standard
      output.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzrlib`` now exports explicit API compatibility information to assist
      library users and plugins. See the ``bzrlib.api`` module for details.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Remove unnecessary lock probes when acquiring a lockdir.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr --version`` now shows the location of the bzr log file, which
      is especially useful on Windows.  (Martin Pool)

    * -D now supports hooks to get debug tracing of hooks (though its currently
      minimal in nature). (Robert Collins)

    * Long log format reports deltas on merge revisions. 
      (John Arbash Meinel, Kent Gibson)

    * Make initial push over ftp more resilient. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Print a summary of changes for update just like pull does.
      (Daniel Watkins, #113990)

    * Add a -Dhpss option to trace smart protocol requests and responses.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

  LIBRARY API BREAKS:

    * Testing cleanups - 
     ``bzrlib.repository.RepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations``;
      ``bzrlib.repository.InterRepositoryTestProviderAdapter`` has been moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.interrepository_implementations``;
      ``bzrlib.transport.TransportTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to 
      ``bzrlib.tests.test_transport_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.branch.BranchTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
      ``bzrlib.tests.branch_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDirTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to 
      ``bzrlib.tests.bzrdir_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.versionedfile.InterVersionedFileTestProviderAdapter`` has moved
      to ``bzrlib.tests.interversionedfile_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.store.revision.RevisionStoreTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
      ``bzrlib.tests.revisionstore_implementations``.
      ``bzrlib.workingtree.WorkingTreeTestProviderAdapter`` has moved to
      ``bzrlib.tests.workingtree_implementations``.
      These changes are an API break in the testing infrastructure only.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Relocate TestCaseWithRepository to be more central. (Robert Collins)

      win32. Callers of the function should do this and use the new
      ``MutableTree.smart_add`` method instead. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.add.FastPath`` is now private and moved to 
      ``bzrlib.mutabletree._FastPath``. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

This survey is now live and I've deleted the 'draft' results until now.
The title no longer says Draft to reflect this status.

It looks like there was one response in the last 30 minutes that was
real. I saved that data before clearing and I'll re-enter it once I
return from holidays next week.

I am happy to announce the Release Candidate 1 of Bazaar 0.90. This
release provides over 50 changes, including:

 * 10 bugfixes
 * 25 user visible improvements
 * 20+ enhancements to internals.

Some of the highlights include pyrex implementations of some performance
critical functions, algorithm changes giving performance improvements to
merging and merge directive generation, a send command which will make
contributing changes back easier and connection sharing to reduce the
number of connections that must be made to a remote location in some
situations.

As noted above this release includes optional pyrex implementations of
some performance critical functions. In order to use these you need to
compile them before installing. If you are running from source then
it is recommended to use 'make' to build and install Bazaar. 'make' will
take care of compiling the extensions for you. If you use
'python setup.py install' then the extensions will also be compiled for
you as well. Note that you will need the python headers installed in
order to compile the extensions against them. On some Linux
distributions that may involve installing an extra package (commonly
called python-dev or python-devel).

If you would like to help us improve Bazaar by telling us about yourself
and what we could do better, please register and complete the online
survey here:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=3DL94RvLswhKdktrxiHWiX3g_3d_3d.

Tarballs:

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.90rc1.tar.gz

and GPG signature:

http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.90rc1.tar.gz.sig

  (signed with B577FE13)

Please test this release and report any problems.  If there are no major
problems, this release will become 0.90 final on or around the target
release date of 21-Aug-2007.

I've attached a summary of the changes in 0.90rc1, based on NEWS.
*Authors of plug-ins and 3rd party tools should note the library API
breaks section in particular.*

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release!

Thanks,

James Westby - 0.90 Release Manager


bzr 0.90rc1 2007-08-14

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr init`` should connect to the remote location one time only.  =
We
      have been connecting several times because we forget to pass around=
 the
      Transport object. This modifies ``BzrDir.create_branch_convenience`=
`,
      so that we can give it the Transport we already have.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil, #111702)

    * Get rid of sftp connection cache (get rid of the FTP one too).
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #43731)

    * bzr branch {local|remote} remote don't try to create a working tree
      anymore.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #112173)

    * All identified multiple connections for a single bzr command have b=
een
      fixed. See bzrlib/tests/commands directory.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``bzr rm`` now does not insist on ``--force`` to delete files that
      have been renamed but not otherwise modified.  (Marius Kruger,
      #111664)

    * ``bzr selftest --bench`` no longer emits deprecation warnings
      (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD)

    * ``bzr status`` now honours FILE parameters for conflict lists
      (Aaron Bentley, #127606)

    * ``bzr checkout`` now honours -r when reconstituting a working tree.
      It also honours -r 0.  (Aaron Bentley, #127708)

    * ``bzr add *`` no more fails on Windows if working tree contains
      non-ascii file names. (Kuno Meyer, #127361)

    * allow ``easy_install bzr`` runs without fatal errors.=20
      (Alexander Belchenko, #125521)

    * Graph._filter_candidate_lca does not raise KeyError if a candidate
      is eliminated just before it would normally be examined.  (Aaron Be=
ntley)

    * SMTP connection failures produce a nice message, not a traceback.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Don't show "dots" progress indicators when run non-interactively, s=
uch
      as from cron.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``info`` now formats locations more nicely and lists "submit" and
      "public" branches (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``pack`` command that will trigger database compression within
      the repository (Robert Collins)

    * Implement ``_KnitIndex._load_data`` in a pyrex extension. The pyrex
      version is approximately 2-3x faster at parsing a ``.kndx`` file.
      Which yields a measurable improvement for commands which have to
      read from the repository, such as a 1s =3D> 0.75s improvement in
      ``bzr diff`` when there are changes to be shown.  (John Arbash Mein=
el)

    * Merge is now faster.  Depending on the scenario, it can be more tha=
n 2x
      faster. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Give a clearer warning, and allow ``python setup.py install`` to
      succeed even if pyrex is not available.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``DirState._read_dirblocks`` now has an optional Pyrex
      implementation. This improves the speed of any command that has to
      read the entire DirState. (``diff``, ``status``, etc, improve by
      about 10%).
      ``bisect_dirblocks`` has also been improved, which helps all
      ``_get_entry`` type calls (whenever we are searching for a
      particular entry in the in-memory DirState).
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr pull`` and ``bzr push`` no longer do a complete walk of the=20
      branch revision history for ui display unless -v is supplied.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr log -rA..B`` output shifted to the left margin if the log onl=
y=20
      contains merge revisions. (Kent Gibson)=20

    * The ``plugins`` command is now public with improved help.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * New bundle and merge directive formats are faster to generate, and
      more robust against email mangling.  New `send` command replaces
      `bundle-revisions` and `merge-directive`.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Annotate merge now works when there are local changes. (Aaron Bentl=
ey)

    * Commit now only shows the progress in terms of directories instead =
of
      entries. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Fix ``KnitRepository.get_revision_graph`` to not request the graph =
2
      times. This makes ``get_revision_graph`` 2x faster. (John Arbash
      Meinel)

    * Fix ``VersionedFile.get_graph()`` to avoid using
      ``set.difference_update(other)``, which has bad scaling when
      ``other`` is large. This improves ``VF.get_graph([version_id])`` fo=
r
      a 12.5k graph from 2.9s down to 200ms. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The ``--lsprof-file`` option now generates output for KCacheGrind i=
f
      the file starts with ``callgrind.out``. This matches the default fi=
le
      filtering done by KCacheGrind's Open Dialog. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Fix ``bzr update`` to avoid an unnecessary
      ``branch.get_master_branch`` call, which avoids 1 extra connection
      to the remote server. (Partial fix for #128076, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Log errors from the smart server in the trace file, to make debuggi=
ng=20
      test failures (and live failures!) easier.  (Andrew Bennetts)
     =20
    * The HTML version of the man page has been superceded by a more
      comprehensive manual called the Bazaar User Reference. This manual
      is completed generated from the online help topics. As part of this
      change, limited reStructuredText is now explicitly supported in hel=
p
      topics and command help with 'unnatural' markup being removed prior
      to display by the online help or inclusion in the man page.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * HTML documentation now use files extension *.html (Alexander Belche=
nko)

    * The cache of ignore definitions is now cleared in WorkingTree.unloc=
k()
      so that changes to .bzrignore aren't missed. (#129694, Daniel Watki=
ns)

    * ``bzr selftest --strict'' fails if there are any missing features o=
r
      expected test failures. (Daniel Watkins, #111914)

    * Link to registration survey added to README. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Windows standalone installer show link to registration survey
      when installation finished. (Alexander Belchenko)

  LIBRARY API BREAKS:

    * Deprecated dictionary ``bzrlib.option.SHORT_OPTIONS`` removed.
      Options are now required to provide a help string and it must
      comply with the style guide by being one or more sentences with an
      initial capital and final period. (Martin Pool)

    * KnitIndex.get_parents now returns tuples. (Robert Collins)

    * Ancient unused ``Repository.text_store`` attribute has been removed=
.
      (Robert Collins)

    * The ``bzrlib.pack`` interface has changed to use tuples of bytestri=
ngs
      rather than just bytestrings, making it easier to represent multipl=
e
      element names. As this interface was not used by any internal facil=
ities
      since it was introduced in 0.18 no API compatibility is being prese=
rved.
      The serialised form of these packs is identical with 0.18 when a si=
ngle
      element tuple is in use. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * merge now uses ``iter_changes`` to calculate changes, which makes r=
oom for
      future performance increases.  It is also more consistent with othe=
r
      operations that perform comparisons, and reduces reliance on
      Tree.inventory.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Refactoring of transport classes connected to a remote server.
      ConnectedTransport is a new class that serves as a basis for all
      transports needing to connect to a remote server.  transport.split_=
url
      have been deprecated, use the static method on the object instead. =
URL
      tests have been refactored too.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Better connection sharing for ConnectedTransport objects.
      transport.get_transport() now accepts a 'possible_transports' param=
eter.
      If a newly requested transport can share a connection with one of t=
he
      list, it will.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Most functions now accept ``bzrlib.revision.NULL_REVISION`` to indi=
cate
      the null revision, and consider using ``None`` for this purpose
      deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``index`` module with abstract index functionality. This will b=
e
      used during the planned changes in the repository layer. Currently =
the
      index layer provides a graph aware immutable index, a builder for t=
he
      same index type to allow creating them, and finally a composer for
      such indices to allow the use of many indices in a single query. Th=
e
      index performance is not optimised, however the API is stable to al=
low
      development on top of the index. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.dirstate.cmp_by_dirs`` can be used to compare two paths by
      their directory sections. This is equivalent to comparing
      ``path.split('/')``, only without having to split the paths.
      This has a Pyrex implementation available.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New transport decorator 'unlistable+' which disables the list_dir
      functionality for testing.

    * Deprecated ``change_entry`` in transform.py. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * RevisionTree.get_weave is now deprecated.  Tree.plan_merge is now u=
sed
      for performing annotate-merge.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New EmailMessage class to create email messages. (Adeodato Sim=C3=B3=
)

    * Unused functions on the private interface KnitIndex have been remov=
ed.
      (Robert Collins)

    * New ``knit.KnitGraphIndex`` which provides a ``KnitIndex`` layered =
on top
      of a ``index.GraphIndex``. (Robert Collins)

    * New ``knit.KnitVersionedFile.iter_parents`` method that allows quer=
ying
      the parents of many knit nodes at once, reducing round trips to the=
=20
      underlying index. (Robert Collins)

    * Graph now has an is_ancestor method, various bits use it.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * The ``-Dhpss`` flag now includes timing information. As well as
      logging when a new connection is opened. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now returns an offset, length tuple=
 to
      callers when inserting data, allowing generation of readv style acc=
ess
      during pack creation, without needing a separate pass across the ou=
tput
      pack to gather such details. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.pack.make_readv_reader`` allows readv based access to pack
      files that are stored on a transport. (Robert Collins)

    * New ``Repository.has_same_location`` method that reports if two
      repository objects refer to the same repository (although with some=
 risk
      of false negatives).  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * InterTree.compare now passes require_versioned on correctly.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * New methods on Repository - ``start_write_group``,
      ``commit_write_group``, ``abort_write_group`` and ``is_in_write_gro=
up`` -
      which provide a clean hook point for transactional Repositories - o=
nes
      where all the data for a fetch or commit needs to be made atomicall=
y
      available in one step. This allows the write lock to remain while m=
aking
      a series of data insertions.  (e.g. data conversion). (Robert Colli=
ns)

    * In ``bzrlib.knit`` the internal interface has been altered to use
      3-tuples (index, pos, length) rather than two-tuples (pos, length) =
to
      describe where data in a knit is, allowing knits to be split into=20
      many files. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.knit._KnitData`` split into cache management and physical =
access
      with two access classes - ``_PackAccess`` and ``_KnitAccess`` defin=
ed.
      The former provides access into a .pack file, and the latter provid=
es the
      current production repository form of .knit files. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * Remove selftest ``--clean-output``, ``--numbered-dirs`` and
      ``--keep-output`` options, which are obsolete now that tests
      are done within directories in $TMPDIR.  (Martin Pool)

    * The SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable is now reset to avoid=20
      interaction with any running ssh agents.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #125955=

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 0.90.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 0.90.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- Doesn't emit compatibility warnings when non-bzrtools commands are run
- branches command works properly on http (apache) and bzr: protocol
- multi-pull reuses transports where possible
- show-paths is now hidden (will be removed in a future release)
- import command can download archives directly from a URL
- shelve gives a better error when binary patches are encoutered
- uses NULL_REVISION in place of None
- options match new grammar requirements

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 0.90.0 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.90.0.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-0.90.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

I am happy to announce the release of Bazaar 0.90. This
release provides over 50 changes, including:

 * 10 bugfixes
 * 25 user visible improvements
 * 20+ enhancements to internals.

Some of the highlights include pyrex implementations of some performance
critical functions, algorithm changes giving performance improvements to
merging and merge directive generation, a send command which will make
contributing changes back easier and connection sharing to reduce the
number of connections that must be made to a remote location in some
situations.

As noted above this release includes optional pyrex implementations of
some performance critical functions. In order to use these you need to
compile them before installing. If you are running from source then
it is recommended to use 'make' to build and install Bazaar. 'make' will
take care of compiling the extensions for you. If you use
'python setup.py install' then the extensions will also be compiled for
you as well. Note that you will need the python headers installed in
order to compile the extensions against them. On some Linux
distributions that may involve installing an extra package (commonly
called python-dev or python-devel).

If you would like to help us improve Bazaar by telling us about yourself
and what we could do better, please register and complete the online
survey here:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=3DL94RvLswhKdktrxiHWiX3g_3d_3d.

  (signed with B577FE13)

I've attached a summary of the changes in 0.90 since 0.18, based on
NEWS. Since the release candidate there has been one important
regression fixed involving URLs using the bzr:// protocol.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release!

Thanks,

James Westby - 0.90 Release Manager


bzr 0.90 2007-08-28

  BUGFIXES:

    * Fix ''bzr info bzr://host/'' and other operations on ''bzr://' URLs=
 with
      an implicit port.  We were incorrectly raising PathNotChild due to
      inconsistent treatment of the ''_port'' attribute on the Transport =
object.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Andrew Bennetts, #133965)

    * ``bzr init`` should connect to the remote location one time only.  =
We
      have been connecting several times because we forget to pass around=
 the
      Transport object. This modifies ``BzrDir.create_branch_convenience`=
`,
      so that we can give it the Transport we already have.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil, #111702)

    * Get rid of sftp connection cache (get rid of the FTP one too).
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #43731)

    * bzr branch {local|remote} remote don't try to create a working tree
      anymore.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #112173)

    * All identified multiple connections for a single bzr command have b=
een
      fixed. See bzrlib/tests/commands directory.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``bzr rm`` now does not insist on ``--force`` to delete files that
      have been renamed but not otherwise modified.  (Marius Kruger,
      #111664)

    * ``bzr selftest --bench`` no longer emits deprecation warnings
      (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD)

    * ``bzr status`` now honours FILE parameters for conflict lists
      (Aaron Bentley, #127606)

    * ``bzr checkout`` now honours -r when reconstituting a working tree.
      It also honours -r 0.  (Aaron Bentley, #127708)

    * ``bzr add *`` no more fails on Windows if working tree contains
      non-ascii file names. (Kuno Meyer, #127361)

    * allow ``easy_install bzr`` runs without fatal errors.=20
      (Alexander Belchenko, #125521)

    * Graph._filter_candidate_lca does not raise KeyError if a candidate
      is eliminated just before it would normally be examined.  (Aaron Be=
ntley)

    * SMTP connection failures produce a nice message, not a traceback.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Documentation is now organized into multiple directories with a lev=
el
      added for different languages or locales. Added the Mini Tutorial
      and Quick Start Summary (en) documents from the Wiki, improving the
      content and readability of the former. Formatted NEWS as Release No=
tes
      complete with a Table of Conents, one heading per release. Moved th=
e
      Developer Guide into the main document catalog and provided a link
      from the developer document catalog back to the main one.
      (Ian Clatworthy, Sabin Iacob, Alexander Belchenko)

    * Don't show "dots" progress indicators when run non-interactively, s=
uch
      as from cron.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``info`` now formats locations more nicely and lists "submit" and
      "public" branches (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``pack`` command that will trigger database compression within
      the repository (Robert Collins)

    * Implement ``_KnitIndex._load_data`` in a pyrex extension. The pyrex
      version is approximately 2-3x faster at parsing a ``.kndx`` file.
      Which yields a measurable improvement for commands which have to
      read from the repository, such as a 1s =3D> 0.75s improvement in
      ``bzr diff`` when there are changes to be shown.  (John Arbash Mein=
el)

    * Merge is now faster.  Depending on the scenario, it can be more tha=
n 2x
      faster. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Give a clearer warning, and allow ``python setup.py install`` to
      succeed even if pyrex is not available.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``DirState._read_dirblocks`` now has an optional Pyrex
      implementation. This improves the speed of any command that has to
      read the entire DirState. (``diff``, ``status``, etc, improve by
      about 10%).
      ``bisect_dirblocks`` has also been improved, which helps all
      ``_get_entry`` type calls (whenever we are searching for a
      particular entry in the in-memory DirState).
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr pull`` and ``bzr push`` no longer do a complete walk of the=20
      branch revision history for ui display unless -v is supplied.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr log -rA..B`` output shifted to the left margin if the log onl=
y=20
      contains merge revisions. (Kent Gibson)=20

    * The ``plugins`` command is now public with improved help.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * New bundle and merge directive formats are faster to generate, and
      more robust against email mangling.  New `send` command replaces
      `bundle-revisions` and `merge-directive`.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Annotate merge now works when there are local changes. (Aaron Bentl=
ey)

    * Commit now only shows the progress in terms of directories instead =
of
      entries. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Fix ``KnitRepository.get_revision_graph`` to not request the graph =
2
      times. This makes ``get_revision_graph`` 2x faster. (John Arbash
      Meinel)

    * Fix ``VersionedFile.get_graph()`` to avoid using
      ``set.difference_update(other)``, which has bad scaling when
      ``other`` is large. This improves ``VF.get_graph([version_id])`` fo=
r
      a 12.5k graph from 2.9s down to 200ms. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The ``--lsprof-file`` option now generates output for KCacheGrind i=
f
      the file starts with ``callgrind.out``. This matches the default fi=
le
      filtering done by KCacheGrind's Open Dialog. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Fix ``bzr update`` to avoid an unnecessary
      ``branch.get_master_branch`` call, which avoids 1 extra connection
      to the remote server. (Partial fix for #128076, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Log errors from the smart server in the trace file, to make debuggi=
ng=20
      test failures (and live failures!) easier.  (Andrew Bennetts)
     =20
    * The HTML version of the man page has been superceded by a more
      comprehensive manual called the Bazaar User Reference. This manual
      is completed generated from the online help topics. As part of this
      change, limited reStructuredText is now explicitly supported in hel=
p
      topics and command help with 'unnatural' markup being removed prior
      to display by the online help or inclusion in the man page.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * HTML documentation now use files extension *.html (Alexander Belche=
nko)

    * The cache of ignore definitions is now cleared in WorkingTree.unloc=
k()
      so that changes to .bzrignore aren't missed. (#129694, Daniel Watki=
ns)

    * ``bzr selftest --strict'' fails if there are any missing features o=
r
      expected test failures. (Daniel Watkins, #111914)

    * Link to registration survey added to README. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Windows standalone installer show link to registration survey
      when installation finished. (Alexander Belchenko)

  LIBRARY API BREAKS:

    * Deprecated dictionary ``bzrlib.option.SHORT_OPTIONS`` removed.
      Options are now required to provide a help string and it must
      comply with the style guide by being one or more sentences with an
      initial capital and final period. (Martin Pool)

    * KnitIndex.get_parents now returns tuples. (Robert Collins)

    * Ancient unused ``Repository.text_store`` attribute has been removed=
.
      (Robert Collins)

    * The ``bzrlib.pack`` interface has changed to use tuples of bytestri=
ngs
      rather than just bytestrings, making it easier to represent multipl=
e
      element names. As this interface was not used by any internal facil=
ities
      since it was introduced in 0.18 no API compatibility is being prese=
rved.
      The serialised form of these packs is identical with 0.18 when a si=
ngle
      element tuple is in use. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * merge now uses ``iter_changes`` to calculate changes, which makes r=
oom for
      future performance increases.  It is also more consistent with othe=
r
      operations that perform comparisons, and reduces reliance on
      Tree.inventory.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Refactoring of transport classes connected to a remote server.
      ConnectedTransport is a new class that serves as a basis for all
      transports needing to connect to a remote server.  transport.split_=
url
      have been deprecated, use the static method on the object instead. =
URL
      tests have been refactored too.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Better connection sharing for ConnectedTransport objects.
      transport.get_transport() now accepts a 'possible_transports' param=
eter.
      If a newly requested transport can share a connection with one of t=
he
      list, it will.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Most functions now accept ``bzrlib.revision.NULL_REVISION`` to indi=
cate
      the null revision, and consider using ``None`` for this purpose
      deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``index`` module with abstract index functionality. This will b=
e
      used during the planned changes in the repository layer. Currently =
the
      index layer provides a graph aware immutable index, a builder for t=
he
      same index type to allow creating them, and finally a composer for
      such indices to allow the use of many indices in a single query. Th=
e
      index performance is not optimised, however the API is stable to al=
low
      development on top of the index. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.dirstate.cmp_by_dirs`` can be used to compare two paths by
      their directory sections. This is equivalent to comparing
      ``path.split('/')``, only without having to split the paths.
      This has a Pyrex implementation available.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New transport decorator 'unlistable+' which disables the list_dir
      functionality for testing.

    * Deprecated ``change_entry`` in transform.py. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * RevisionTree.get_weave is now deprecated.  Tree.plan_merge is now u=
sed
      for performing annotate-merge.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New EmailMessage class to create email messages. (Adeodato Sim=C3=B3=
)

    * Unused functions on the private interface KnitIndex have been remov=
ed.
      (Robert Collins)

    * New ``knit.KnitGraphIndex`` which provides a ``KnitIndex`` layered =
on top
      of a ``index.GraphIndex``. (Robert Collins)

    * New ``knit.KnitVersionedFile.iter_parents`` method that allows quer=
ying
      the parents of many knit nodes at once, reducing round trips to the=
=20
      underlying index. (Robert Collins)

    * Graph now has an is_ancestor method, various bits use it.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * The ``-Dhpss`` flag now includes timing information. As well as
      logging when a new connection is opened. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now returns an offset, length tuple=
 to
      callers when inserting data, allowing generation of readv style acc=
ess
      during pack creation, without needing a separate pass across the ou=
tput
      pack to gather such details. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.pack.make_readv_reader`` allows readv based access to pack
      files that are stored on a transport. (Robert Collins)

    * New ``Repository.has_same_location`` method that reports if two
      repository objects refer to the same repository (although with some=
 risk
      of false negatives).  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * InterTree.compare now passes require_versioned on correctly.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * New methods on Repository - ``start_write_group``,
      ``commit_write_group``, ``abort_write_group`` and ``is_in_write_gro=
up`` -
      which provide a clean hook point for transactional Repositories - o=
nes
      where all the data for a fetch or commit needs to be made atomicall=
y
      available in one step. This allows the write lock to remain while m=
aking
      a series of data insertions.  (e.g. data conversion). (Robert Colli=
ns)

    * In ``bzrlib.knit`` the internal interface has been altered to use
      3-tuples (index, pos, length) rather than two-tuples (pos, length) =
to
      describe where data in a knit is, allowing knits to be split into=20
      many files. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.knit._KnitData`` split into cache management and physical =
access
      with two access classes - ``_PackAccess`` and ``_KnitAccess`` defin=
ed.
      The former provides access into a .pack file, and the latter provid=
es the
      current production repository form of .knit files. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * Remove selftest ``--clean-output``, ``--numbered-dirs`` and
      ``--keep-output`` options, which are obsolete now that tests
      are done within directories in $TMPDIR.  (Martin Pool)

    * The SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable is now reset to avoid=20
      interaction with any running ssh agents.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #125955=
)

I'm happy to announce the first release candidate of Bazaar 0.91.
This release contains over 40 distinct user-visible enhancements or
bug fixes, detailed below.  There are substantial improvements in the
speed of commit, update, diff, send, and pull/merge of bundles.

The Python source code is available from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.91rc1.tar.gz and packages and
Windows installers should be available soon from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

As for the previous release, this version of Bazaar contains optional
compiled extension modules to speed core operations.  They will be
automatically built if a C compiler is available at installation time.

This release candidate will become Bazaar 0.91 on the 18th of
September, depending on user feedback.  We'd particularly appreciate
feedback on use of Bazaar on non-Linux i386 platforms.

If you would like to help us improve Bazaar by telling us about
yourself and what we could do better, please register and complete the
online survey here:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=3DL94RvLswhKdktrxiHWiX3g_3d_3d.

Thanks very much to everyone who contributed suggestions, code,
documentation or bug reports for this release.  Keep them coming!

Martin
Bazaar 0.91 release manager


bzr 0.91 2007-09-11
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  CHANGES:

   * The default branch and repository format has changed to
     ``dirstate-tags``, so tag commands are active by default.
     This format is compatible with Bazaar 0.15 and later.
     This incidentally fixes bug #126141.
     (Martin Pool)

   * ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is no longer a global option. If present, it
     must now appear after the command name. Scripts doing things like
     ``bzr -q missing`` need to be rewritten as ``bzr missing -q``.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

  FEATURES:

   * New option ``--author`` in ``bzr commit`` to specify the author of the
     change, if it's different from the committer. ``bzr log`` and
     ``bzr annotate`` display the author instead of the committer.
     (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * In addition to global options and command specific options, a set of
     standard options are now supported. Standard options are legal for
     all commands. The initial set of standard options are:

     * ``--help`` or ``-h`` - display help message
     * ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` - display additional information
     * ``--quiet``  or ``-q`` - only output warnings and errors.

     Unlike global options, standard options can be used in aliases and
     may have command-specific help. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Verbosity level processing has now been unified. If ``--verbose``
     or ``-v`` is specified on the command line multiple times, the
     verbosity level is made positive the first time then increased.
     If ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is specified on the command line
     multiple times, the verbosity level is made negative the first
     time then decreased. To get the default verbosity level of zero,
     either specify none of the above , ``--no-verbose`` or ``--no-quiet``.
     Note that most commands currently ignore the magnitude of the
     verbosity level but do respect *quiet vs normal vs verbose* when
     generating output. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * ``Branch.hooks`` now supports ``pre_commit`` hook. The hook's signatur=
e
     is documented in BranchHooks constructor. (Nam T. Nguyen, #102747)

  BUG FIXES:

   * ``bzr plugins`` now lists the version number for each plugin in square
     brackets after the path. (Robert Collins, #125421)

   * Suppress warning "integer argument expected, got float" from Paramiko,
     which sometimes caused false test failures.  (Martin Pool)

   * Fix bug in bundle 4 that could cause attempts to write data to wrong
     versionedfile.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * Diffs generated using "diff -p" no longer break the patch parser.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * get_transport treats an empty possible_transports list the same as a n=
on-
     empty one.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * patch verification for merge directives is reactivated, and works with
     CRLF and CR files.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * Accept ..\ as a path in revision specifiers. This fixes for example
     "-r branch:..\other-branch" on Windows.  (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` may now contain trailing slashes.
     (Blake Winton, #129299)

   * man page no longer lists hidden options (#131667, Aaron Bentley)

   * ``uncommit --help`` now explains the -r option adequately.  (Daniel
     Watkins, #106726)

   * Error messages are now better formatted with parameters (such as
     filenames) quoted when necessary. This avoids confusion when directory
     names ending in a '.' at the end of messages were confused with a
     full stop that may or not have been there. (Daniel Watkins, #129791)

   * Fix ``status FILE -r X..Y``. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * If a particular command is an alias, ``help`` will show the alias
     instead of claiming there is no help for said alias. (Daniel Watkins,
     #133548)

   * TreeTransform-based operations, like pull, merge, revert, and branch,
     now roll back if they encounter an error.  (Aaron Bentley, #67699)

   * ``bzr commit`` now exits cleanly if a character unsupported by the
     current encoding is used in the commit message.  (Daniel Watkins,
     #116143)

   * bzr send uses default values for ranges when only half of an elipsis
     is specified ("-r..5" or "-r5..").  (#61685, Aaron Bentley)

   * Avoid trouble when Windows ssh calls itself 'plink' but no plink
     binary is present.  (Martin Albisetti, #107155)

   * ``bzr remove`` should remove clean subtrees.  Now it will remove (with=
out
     needing ``--force``) subtrees that contain no files with text changes =
or
     modified files.  With ``--force`` it removes the subtree regardless of
     text changes or unknown files. Directories with renames in or out (but
     not changed otherwise) will now be removed without needing ``--force``=
.
     Unknown ignored files will be deleted without needing ``--force``.
     (Marius Kruger, #111665)

   * When two plugins conflict, the source of both the losing and now the
     winning definition is shown.  (Konstantin Mikhaylov, #5454)

   * When committing to a branch, the location being committed to is
     displayed.  (Daniel Watkins, #52479)

   * ``bzr --version`` takes care about encoding of stdout, especially
     when output is redirected. (Alexander Belchenko, #131100)

   * Prompt for an ftp password if none is provided.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #137044)

   * Reuse bound branch associated transport to avoid multiple
     connections.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #128076, #131396)

   * Overwrite conflicting tags by ``push`` and ``pull`` if the
     ``--overwrite`` option is specified.  (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #93947)

    * In checkouts, tags are copied into the master branch when created,
      changed or deleted, and are copied into the checkout when it is
      updated.  (Martin Pool, #93856, #93860)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * Add the option "--show-diff" to the commit command in order to display
     the diff during the commit log creation. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

   * ``pull`` and ``merge`` are much faster at installing bundle format 4.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``pull -v`` no longer includes deltas, making it much faster.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``send`` now sends the directive as an attachment by default.
     (Aaron Bentley, Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, Alexander Belchenko)

   * Documentation updates (Martin Albisetti)

   * Help on debug flags is now included in ``help global-options``.
     (Daniel Watkins, #124853)

   * Parameters passed on the command line are checked to ensure they are
     supported by the encoding in use. (Daniel Watkins)

   * The compression used within the bzr repository has changed from zlib
     level 9 to the zlib default level. This improves commit performance wi=
th
     only a small increase in space used (and in some cases a reduction in
     space). (Robert Collins)

   * Initial commit no longer SHAs files twice and now reuses the path
     rather than looking it up again, making it faster.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

   * New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``diff`` and ``status`` to show
     changes in one revision.  (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * If versioned files match a given ignore pattern, a warning is now
     given. (Daniel Watkins, #48623)

   * ``bzr status`` now has -S as a short name for --short and -V as a
     short name for --versioned. These have been added to assist users
     migrating from Subversion: ``bzr status -SV`` is now like
     ``svn status -q``.  (Daniel Watkins, #115990)

   * Added C implementation of  ``PatienceSequenceMatcher``, which is about
     10x faster than the Python version. This speeds up commands that
     need file diffing, such as ``bzr commit`` or ``bzr diff``.
     (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * HACKING has been extended with a large section on core developer tasks=
.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Add ``branches`` and ``standalone-trees`` as online help topics and
     include them as Concepts within the User Reference.
     (Paul Moore, Ian Clatworthy)

  API BREAKS:

   * ``Branch.append_revision`` is removed altogether; please use
     ``Branch.set_last_revision_info`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

   * CommitBuilder now advertises itself as requiring the root entry to be
     supplied. This only affects foreign repository implementations which r=
euse
     CommitBuilder directly and have changed record_entry_contents to requi=
re
     that the root not be supplied. This should be precisely zero plugins
     affected. (Robert Collins)

   * The ``add_lines`` methods on ``VersionedFile`` implementations has cha=
nged
     its return value to include the sha1 and length of the inserted text. =
This
     allows the avoidance of double-sha1 calculations during commit.
     (Robert Collins)

   * ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
     previous release.  (Martin Pool)

  TESTING:

   * Tests may now raise TestNotApplicable to indicate they shouldn't be
     run in a particular scenario.  (Martin Pool)

   * New function multiply_tests_from_modules to give a simpler interface
     to test parameterization.  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

   * ``Transport.should_cache`` has been removed.  It was not called in the
     previous release.  (Martin Pool)

   * NULL_REVISION is returned to indicate the null revision, not None.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * Use UTF-8 encoded StringIO for log tests to avoid failures on
     non-ASCII committer names.  (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

  INTERNALS:

   * ``bzrlib.plugin.all_plugins`` has been deprecated in favour of
     ``bzrlib.plugin.plugins()`` which returns PlugIn objects that provide
     useful functionality for determining the path of a plugin, its tests, =
and
     its version information. (Robert Collins)

   * Add the option user_encoding to the function 'show_diff_trees()'
     in order to move the user encoding at the UI level. (Goffredo Baroncel=
li)

   * Add the function make_commit_message_template_encoded() and the functi=
on
     edit_commit_message_encoded() which handle encoded strings.
     This is done in order to mix the commit messages (which is a unicode
     string), and the diff which is a raw string. (Goffredo Baroncelli)

   * CommitBuilder now defaults to using add_lines_with_ghosts, reducing
     overhead on non-weave repositories which don't require all parents to =
be
     present. (Robert Collins)

   * Deprecated method ``find_previous_heads`` on
     ``bzrlib.inventory.InventoryEntry``. This has been superseded by the u=
se
     of ``parent_candidates`` and a separate heads check via the repository
     API. (Robert Collins)

   * New trace function ``mutter_callsite`` will print out a subset of the
     stack to the log, which can be useful for gathering debug details.
     (Robert Collins)

   * ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now tracks how many records have been
     added via a public attribute records_written. (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.get_recommended_page_size``.
     This provides a hint to users of transports as to the reasonable
     minimum data to read. In principle this can take latency and
     bandwidth into account on a per-connection basis, but for now it
     just has hard coded values based on the url. (e.g. http:// has a large
     page size, file:// has a small one.) (Robert Collins)

   * New method on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport`` ``open_write_stream`` all=
ows
     incremental addition of data to a file without requiring that all the
     data be buffered in memory. (Robert Collins)

   * New methods on ``bzrlib.knit.KnitVersionedFile``:
     ``get_data_stream(versions)``, ``insert_data_stream(stream)`` and
     ``get_format_signature()``.  These provide some infrastructure for
     efficiently streaming the knit data for a set of versions over the sma=
rt
     protocol.

   * Knits with no annotation cache still produce correct annotations.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * Three new methods have been added to ``bzrlib.trace``:
     ``set_verbosity_level``, ``get_verbosity_level`` and ``is_verbose``.
     ``set_verbosity_level`` expects a numeric value: negative for quiet,
     zero for normal, positive for verbose. The size of the number can be
     used to determine just how quiet or verbose the application should be.
     The existing ``be_quiet`` and ``is_quiet`` routines have been
     integrated into this new scheme. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Options can now be delcared with a ``custom_callback`` parameter. If
     set, this routine is called after the option is processed. This featur=
e
     is now used by the standard options ``verbose`` and ``quiet`` so that
     setting one implicitly resets the other. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Rather than declaring a new option from scratch in order to provide
     custom help, a centrally registered option can be decorated using the
     new ``bzrlib.Option.custom_help`` routine. In particular, this routine
     is useful when declaring better help for the ``verbose`` and ``quiet``
     standard options as the base definition of these is now more complex
     than before thanks to their use of a custom callback. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Tree._iter_changes(specific_file=3D[]) now iterates through no files,
      instead of iterating through all files.  None is used to iterate thro=
ugh
      all files.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * WorkingTree.revert() now accepts None to revert all files.  The use o=
f
      [] to revert all files is deprecated.  (Aaron Bentley)

Due to an error in packaging, I'm immediately replacing this with rc2.
 There are no other changes.

Hi,

we've just released another minor release of bzr-gtk, 0.91.0. This
release fixes some bugs, and adds a couple more UI bits and is intended
to be compatible with Bazaar 0.91.

The changes since 0.90.0 are:

 UI

  * Added keyboard shortcuts for closing windows and exiting Olive.
    (#139559, Daniel Schierbeck)

  * The tip revision will be automatically selected in the branch
visualization
    window. (#144244, Daniel Schierbeck)

  * Updated olive-gtk.desktop: Polish translation and additional categories.
    (Mateusz Korniak)

 BUG FIXES

  * Fix the "Complete Diff" entry in DiffWindow to show the whole diff.
    (#140512, James Westby)

  * Right-clicking in Olive's file list works again. (#136310, Mark Lee)

  * Annotate context menu works again. (Daniel Schierbeck)

  * Fixed push (with overwite) behavior when branches are diverged.
    (Mateusz Korniak)

  * Local missing revisions are remote extra revisions (Missing
revisions menu
    item in Olive). (Mateusz Korniak)

 INTERNALS

  * `bzr viz --limit` much more faster than before. (John Arbash Meinel)

  * Use get_apparent_author, rename variables to 'author'. (Aaron Bentley)

  * Added default_branch_path to MergeDialog and use it from olive-gtk.
    (Mateusz Korniak)

This release can be downloaded from:

 * https://launchpad.net/bzr-gtk/0.91/0.91.0/+download/bzr-gtk-0.91.0.tar.gz
(mirror: http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.91.0.tar.gz)

The tarball (the .tar.gz) has been signed with my GPG key (F1D076A3).
The signature can be downloaded from
http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.91.0.tar.gz.asc. To verify the
tarball, run:

$ gpg --verify bzr-gtk-0.91.0.tar.gz.asc

Bugs and requests for new features can be reported on launchpad,
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-gtk.

The upcoming 0.92.0 release already has some prospective features, like
making `bzr viz` 5x faster on bzr.dev.

You may notice that the changelog features a bunch of new names. That's
a really great thing that we have so many contributors. On the other
hand the project maintenance became a bit difficult for us. So we
decided to create a bzr-gtk mailing list, and thanks to Jelmer, Martin,
and the Canonical sysadmins, it's already available:

https://lists.canonical.com/mailman/listinfo/bzr-gtk

We also plan to track merge requests, a Budle Buggy instance will be set
up in a few days, thanks to Jelmer.

Another change you may have noticed is that I'm rolling this release
(and probably the following ones as well). Please bear with me, this is
my first time ever :)

Enjoy!

Cheers,
Szilveszter / phanatic

>=20
>   CHANGES:
>=20
>    * The default branch and repository format has changed to=20
>      ``dirstate-tags``, so tag commands are active by default.
>      This format is compatible with Bazaar 0.15 and later.
>      This incidentally fixes bug #126141.
>      (Martin Pool)
>=20
>    * ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is no longer a global option. If present, it
>      must now appear after the command name. Scripts doing things like
>      ``bzr -q missing`` need to be rewritten as ``bzr missing -q``.
>      (Ian Clatworthy)
>=20
>   FEATURES:
>=20
>    * New option ``--author`` in ``bzr commit`` to specify the author of t=
he
>      change, if it's different from the committer. ``bzr log`` and
>      ``bzr annotate`` display the author instead of the committer.
>      (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD)
>=20
>    * In addition to global options and command specific options, a set of
>      standard options are now supported. Standard options are legal for
>      all commands. The initial set of standard options are:
>     =20
>      * ``--help`` or ``-h`` - display help message
>      * ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` - display additional information
>      * ``--quiet``  or ``-q`` - only output warnings and errors.
>=20
>      Unlike global options, standard options can be used in aliases and
>      may have command-specific help. (Ian Clatworthy)
>=20
>    * Verbosity level processing has now been unified. If ``--verbose``
>      or ``-v`` is specified on the command line multiple times, the
>      verbosity level is made positive the first time then increased.
>      If ``--quiet`` or ``-q`` is specified on the command line
>      multiple times, the verbosity level is made negative the first
>      time then decreased. To get the default verbosity level of zero,
>      either specify none of the above , ``--no-verbose`` or ``--no-quiet`=
`.
>      Note that most commands currently ignore the magnitude of the
>      verbosity level but do respect *quiet vs normal vs verbose* when
>      generating output. (Ian Clatworthy)
>=20
>    * ``Branch.hooks`` now supports ``pre_commit`` hook. The hook's signat=
ure
>      is documented in BranchHooks constructor. (Nam T. Nguyen, #102747)
>=20
>   BUG FIXES:
>=20
>    * ``bzr plugins`` now lists the version number for each plugin in squa=
re
>      brackets after the path. (Robert Collins, #125421)
>=20
>    * Pushing, pulling and branching branches with subtree references was =
not
>      copying the subtree weave, preventing the file graph from being acce=
ssed
>      and causing errors in commits in clones. (Robert Collins)
>=20
>    * Suppress warning "integer argument expected, got float" from Paramik=
o,
>      which sometimes caused false test failures.  (Martin Pool)
>=20
>    * Fix bug in bundle 4 that could cause attempts to write data to wrong
>      versionedfile.  (Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * Diffs generated using "diff -p" no longer break the patch parser.
>      (Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * get_transport treats an empty possible_transports list the same as a=
 non-
>      empty one.  (Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * patch verification for merge directives is reactivated, and works wi=
th
>      CRLF and CR files.  (Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * Accept ..\ as a path in revision specifiers. This fixes for example
>      "-r branch:..\other-branch" on Windows.  (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=
=BD)=20
>=20
>    * ``BZR_PLUGIN_PATH`` may now contain trailing slashes.
>      (Blake Winton, #129299)
>=20
>    * man page no longer lists hidden options (#131667, Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * ``uncommit --help`` now explains the -r option adequately.  (Daniel
>      Watkins, #106726)
>=20
>    * Error messages are now better formatted with parameters (such as
>      filenames) quoted when necessary. This avoids confusion when directo=
ry
>      names ending in a '.' at the end of messages were confused with a
>      full stop that may or not have been there. (Daniel Watkins, #129791)
>=20
>    * Fix ``status FILE -r X..Y``. (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD)
>=20
>    * If a particular command is an alias, ``help`` will show the alias
>      instead of claiming there is no help for said alias. (Daniel Watkins=
,
>      #133548)
>=20
>    * TreeTransform-based operations, like pull, merge, revert, and branch=
,
>      now roll back if they encounter an error.  (Aaron Bentley, #67699)
>=20
>    * ``bzr commit`` now exits cleanly if a character unsupported by the
>      current encoding is used in the commit message.  (Daniel Watkins,
>      #116143)
>=20
>    * bzr send uses default values for ranges when only half of an elipsis
>      is specified ("-r..5" or "-r5..").  (#61685, Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * Avoid trouble when Windows ssh calls itself 'plink' but no plink
>      binary is present.  (Martin Albisetti, #107155)
>=20
>    * ``bzr remove`` should remove clean subtrees.  Now it will remove (wi=
thout
>      needing ``--force``) subtrees that contain no files with text change=
s or
>      modified files.  With ``--force`` it removes the subtree regardless =
of
>      text changes or unknown files. Directories with renames in or out (b=
ut
>      not changed otherwise) will now be removed without needing ``--force=
``.
>      Unknown ignored files will be deleted without needing ``--force``.
>      (Marius Kruger, #111665)
>=20
>    * When two plugins conflict, the source of both the losing and now the
>      winning definition is shown.  (Konstantin Mikhaylov, #5454)
>=20
>    * When committing to a branch, the location being committed to is
>      displayed.  (Daniel Watkins, #52479)
>=20
>    * ``bzr --version`` takes care about encoding of stdout, especially
>      when output is redirected. (Alexander Belchenko, #131100)
>=20
>    * Prompt for an ftp password if none is provided.
>      (Vincent Ladeuil, #137044)

>      (Vincent Ladeuil, #128076, #131396)

>=20
>    * In checkouts, tags are copied into the master branch when created,
>      changed or deleted, and are copied into the checkout when it is=20
>      updated.  (Martin Pool, #93856, #93860)
>=20
>   IMPROVEMENTS:
>=20
>    * Add the option "--show-diff" to the commit command in order to displ=
ay
>      the diff during the commit log creation. (Goffredo Baroncelli)
>=20
>    * ``pull`` and ``merge`` are much faster at installing bundle format 4=

>=20

>      (Aaron Bentley)
>=20

>=20
>    * Documentation updates (Martin Albisetti)

>=20
>    * Parameters passed on the command line are checked to ensure they are
>      supported by the encoding in use. (Daniel Watkins)
>=20
>    * The compression used within the bzr repository has changed from zlib

>=20
>    * Initial commit no longer SHAs files twice and now reuses the path
>      rather than looking it up again, making it faster.

>=20
>    * New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``diff`` and ``status`` to show

>=20
>    * If versioned files match a given ignore pattern, a warning is now

>=20
>    * ``bzr status`` now has -S as a short name for --short and -V as a

>=20
>    * Added C implementation of  ``PatienceSequenceMatcher``, which is abo=

>=20
>   API BREAKS:
>=20
>    * ``Branch.append_revision`` is removed altogether; please use=20

>=20
>    * Add the function make_commit_message_template_encoded() and the func=
tion

>=20
>    * Deprecated method ``find_previous_heads`` on

e

>=20
>    * ``bzrlib.pack.ContainerWriter`` now tracks how many records have bee=
n
>      added via a public attribute records_written. (Robert Collins)
>=20
>    * New method ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.get_recommended_page_size``.
>      This provides a hint to users of transports as to the reasonable
>      minimum data to read. In principle this can take latency and
>      bandwidth into account on a per-connection basis, but for now it
>      just has hard coded values based on the url. (e.g. http:// has a lar=
ge
>      page size, file:// has a small one.) (Robert Collins)
>=20
>    * New method on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport`` ``open_write_stream`` a=
llows
>      incremental addition of data to a file without requiring that all th=
e
>      data be buffered in memory. (Robert Collins)
>=20
>    * New methods on ``bzrlib.knit.KnitVersionedFile``:
>      ``get_data_stream(versions)``, ``insert_data_stream(stream)`` and
>      ``get_format_signature()``.  These provide some infrastructure for
>      efficiently streaming the knit data for a set of versions over the s=
mart
>      protocol.
>=20
>    * Knits with no annotation cache still produce correct annotations.
>      (Aaron Bentley)
>=20
>    * Three new methods have been added to ``bzrlib.trace``:
>      ``set_verbosity_level``, ``get_verbosity_level`` and ``is_verbose``.
>      ``set_verbosity_level`` expects a numeric value: negative for quiet,
>      zero for normal, positive for verbose. The size of the number can be
>      used to determine just how quiet or verbose the application should b=
e.
>      The existing ``be_quiet`` and ``is_quiet`` routines have been
>      integrated into this new scheme. (Ian Clatworthy)
>=20
>    * Options can now be delcared with a ``custom_callback`` parameter. If
>      set, this routine is called after the option is processed. This feat=
ure
>      is now used by the standard options ``verbose`` and ``quiet`` so tha=
t
>      setting one implicitly resets the other. (Ian Clatworthy)
>=20
>    * Rather than declaring a new option from scratch in order to provide
>      custom help, a centrally registered option can be decorated using th=
e
>      new ``bzrlib.Option.custom_help`` routine. In particular, this routi=
ne
>      is useful when declaring better help for the ``verbose`` and ``quiet=
``

>      than before thanks to their use of a custom callback. (Ian Clatworth=
y)
>      =20

Hi all,

Next week, I'm going to run two Bazaar documentation meetings in #bzr.

The topic will be: What's missing in the Bazaar documentation?

It'll be a chance for us to get together and chat about which features
and processes are missing from the documentation we have.

To give everyone a chance to attend, there'll be two meetings:

1st October 16.00 UTC (09.00 PDT, 12.00 EDT, 18.00 Amsterdam, 20.00 Moscow)

2nd October 08.00 UTC (15.00 Bangkok, 16.00 Perth, 18.00 Sydney, 21.00 NZ)

If you can't make either of the times, don't worry. I'll post
summaries to the bazaar list and I'm also available in #bzr 08.00 -
17.00 UTC each day.

I've put a skeleton agenda online at:

http://bazaar-vcs.org/OneZeroDocumentation/WhatIsMissingMeeting

Please add to it anything you want to raise.

In the mean time, please feel free to email me directly with any
suggestions or questions.

The packs have landed!

I made fresh windows standalone installer for earlier adopters.
Guys, who use Windows and who want to help Bazaar team
to test and improve new packs format, let's try this:

http://bialix.com/bzr-win32/2007-10-24/bzr-setup-0.92.0.dev.0.exe

With new version of bzr you could initialize new repo
format with flag --experimental, e.g.:

bzr init --experimental BRANCH_NAME
bzr init-repo --experimental SHARED_REPO_NAME

and then try to work with new repo in usual way.
Report about found problems to the list or file a bug in Launchpad.

Thanks.

I'm happy to announce the first release candidate of Bazaar 0.92.  This
release contains around 30 distinct user visible enhancements and
bug-fixes.  There are some substantial improvements to speed,
particularly of commit operations.  A new experimental repository format
has been added.  Details of the changes are given below.

The Python source code is currently available from
http://people.ubuntu.com/~andrew/bzr-0.92rc1.tar.gz and will also be
available soon from the usual location at
http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-0.92rc1.tar.gz.  Packages and
Windows installers will be linked from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as
they become available.

This release will become Bazaar 0.92 in about a week, depending on user
feedback.  We'd particularly appreciate feedback on use of Bazaar on
non-Linux i386 platforms.

Thank you very much to the many people that have contributed to this
release!

-Andrew, on behalf of the Bazaar team


bzr 0.92rc1 2007-10-29
======================

  CHANGES:
  
   * ``bzr`` now returns exit code 4 if an internal error occurred, and 
     3 if a normal error occurred.  (Martin Pool)

   * ``pull``, ``merge`` and ``push`` will no longer silently correct some
     repository index errors that occured as a result of the Weave disk format.
     Instead the ``reconcile`` command needs to be run to correct those
     problems if they exist (and it has been able to fix most such problems
     since bzr 0.8). Some new problems have been identified during this release
     and you should run ``bzr check`` once on every repository to see if you
     need to reconcile. If you cannot ``pull`` or ``merge`` from a remote
     repository due to mismatched parent errors - a symptom of index errors -
     you should simply take a full copy of that remote repository to a clean
     directory outside any local repositories, then run reconcile on it, and
     finally pull from it locally. (And naturally email the repositories owner
     to ask them to upgrade and run reconcile).
     (Robert Collins)

  FEATURES:

   * New ``knitpack-experimental`` repository format. This is interoperable with
     the ``dirstate-tags`` format but uses a smarter storage design that greatly
     speeds up many operations, both local and remote. This new format can be
     used as an option to the ``init``, ``init-repository`` and ``upgrade``
     commands. See http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/developers/knitpack.html
     for further details. (Robert Collins)

   * For users of bzr-svn (and those testing the prototype subtree support) that
     wish to try packs, a new ``knitpack-subtree-experimental`` format has also
     been added. This is interoperable with the ``dirstate-subtrees`` format.
     (Robert Collins)

   * New ``reconfigure`` command. (Aaron Bentley)

   * New ``revert --forget-merges`` command, which removes the record of a pending 
     merge without affecting the working tree contents.  (Martin Pool)

   * New ``bzr_remote_path`` configuration variable allows finer control of
     remote bzr locations than BZR_REMOTE_PATH environment variable.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * New ``launchpad-login`` command to tell Bazaar your Launchpad
     user ID.  This can then be used by other functions of the
     Launchpad plugin. (James Henstridge)

  PERFORMANCE:

   * Commit in quiet mode is now slightly faster as the information to
     output is no longer calculated. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Commit no longer checks for new text keys during insertion when the
     revision id was deterministically unique. (Robert Collins)

   * Committing a change which is not a merge and does not change the number of
     files in the tree is faster by utilising the data about whether files are
     changed to determine if the tree is unchanged rather than recalculating
     it at the end of the commit process. (Robert Collins)

   * Inventory serialisation no longer double-sha's the content.
     (Robert Collins)

   * Knit text reconstruction now avoids making copies of the lines list for
     interim texts when building a single text. The new ``apply_delta`` method
     on ``KnitContent`` aids this by allowing modification of the revision id
     such objects represent. (Robert Collins)

   * Pack indices are now partially parsed for specific key lookup using a
     bisection approach. (Robert Collins)

   * Partial commits are now approximately 40% faster by walking over the
     unselected current tree more efficiently. (Robert Collins)

   * XML inventory serialisation takes 20% less time while being stricter about
     the contents. (Robert Collins)

   * Graph ``heads()`` queries have been fixed to no longer access all history
     unnecessarily. (Robert Collins)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * ``bzr+https://`` smart server across https now supported. 
     (John Ferlito, Martin Pool, #128456)

   * Mutt is now a supported mail client; set ``mail_client=mutt`` in your
     bazaar.conf and ``send`` will use mutt. (Keir Mierle)

   * New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``merge`` command for cherrypicking 
     changes from one revision. (Alexander Belchenko, #141368)

   * Show encodings, locale and list of plugins in the traceback message.
     (Martin Pool, #63894)

   * Experimental directory formats can now be marked with
     ``experimental = True`` during registration. (Ian Clatworthy)

  DOCUMENTATION:

   * New *Bazaar in Five Minutes* guide.  (Matthew Revell)

   * The hooks reference documentation is now converted to html as expected.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

  BUG FIXES:

   * Connection error reporting for the smart server has been fixed to
     display a user friendly message instead of a traceback.
     (Ian Clatworthy, #115601)

   * Make sure to use ``O_BINARY`` when opening files to check their
     sha1sum. (Alexander Belchenko, John Arbash Meinel, #153493)

   * Fix a problem with Win32 handling of the executable bit.
     (John Arbash Meinel, #149113)

   * ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``sftp://`` URLs that do not specify ports explicitly
     no longer assume that means port 22.  This allows people using OpenSSH to
     override the default port in their ``~/.ssh/config`` if they wish.  This
     fixes a bug introduced in bzr 0.91.  (Andrew Bennetts, #146715)

   * Commands reporting exceptions can now be profiled and still have their
     data correctly dumped to a file. For example, a ``bzr commit`` with
     no changes still reports the operation as pointless but doing so no
     longer throws away the profiling data if this command is run with
     ``--lsprof-file callgrind.out.ci`` say. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Fallback to ftp when paramiko is not installed and sftp can't be used for
     ``tests/commands`` so that the test suite is still usable without
     paramiko.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #59150)

   * Fix commit ordering in corner case. (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

   * Fix long standing bug in partial commit when there are renames 
     left in tree. (Robert Collins, #140419)

   * Fix selftest semi-random noise during http related tests.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140614)

   * Fix typo in ftp.py making the reconnection fail on temporary errors.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #154259)

   * Fix failing test by comparing real paths to cover the case where the TMPDIR
     contains a symbolic link.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #141382).

   * Fix log against smart server branches that don't support tags.
     (James Westby, #140615)

   * Fix pycurl http implementation by defining error codes from
     pycurl instead of relying on an old curl definition.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #147530)

   * Fix 'unprintable error' message when displaying BzrCheckError and 
     some other exceptions on Python 2.5.
     (Martin Pool, #144633)

   * Fix ``Inventory.copy()`` and add test for it. (Jelmer Vernooij)

   * Handles default value for ListOption in cmd_commit.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140432)

   * HttpServer and FtpServer need to be closed properly or a listening socket
     will remain opened.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140055)

   * Monitor the .bzr directory created in the top level test
     directory to detect leaking tests.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #147986)

   * The basename, not the full path, is now used when checking whether
     the profiling dump file begins with ``callgrind.out`` or not. This
     fixes a bug reported by Aaron Bentley on IRC. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Trivial fix for invoking command ``reconfigure`` without arguments.
     (Rob Weir, #141629)

   * ``WorkingTree.rename_one`` will now raise an error if normalisation of the
     new path causes bzr to be unable to access the file. (Robert Collins)

   * Correctly detect a NoSuchFile when using a filezilla server. (Gary van der
     Merwe)

  API BREAKS:

   * ``bzrlib.index.GraphIndex`` now requires a size parameter to the
     constructor, for enabling bisection searches. (Robert Collins)

   * ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` now requires the root entry of a
     tree be supplied to it, previously failing to do so would trigger a
     deprecation warning. (Robert Collins)

   * ``KnitVersionedFile.add*`` will no longer cache added records even when
     enable_cache() has been called - the caching feature is now exclusively for
     reading existing data. (Robert Collins)

   * ``ReadOnlyLockError`` is deprecated; ``LockFailed`` is usually more 
     appropriate.  (Martin Pool)

   * Removed ``bzrlib.transport.TransportLogger`` - please see the new
     ``trace+`` transport instead. (Robert Collins)

   * Removed previously deprecated varargs interface to ``TestCase.run_bzr`` and
     deprecated methods ``TestCase.capture`` and ``TestCase.run_bzr_captured``.
     (Martin Pool)

   * Removed previous deprecated ``basis_knit`` parameter to the
     ``KnitVersionedFile`` constructor. (Robert Collins)

   * Special purpose method ``TestCase.run_bzr_decode`` is moved to the test_non_ascii 
     class that needs it.
     (Martin Pool)

   * The class ``bzrlib.repofmt.knitrepo.KnitRepository3`` has been folded into
     ``KnitRepository`` by parameters to the constructor. (Robert Collins)

   * The ``VersionedFile`` interface now allows content checks to be bypassed
     by supplying check_content=False.  This saves nearly 30% of the minimum
     cost to store a version of a file. (Robert Collins)

   * Tree's with bad state such as files with no length or sha will no longer
     be silently accepted by the repository XML serialiser. To serialise
     inventories without such data, pass working=True to write_inventory.
     (Robert Collins)

   * ``VersionedFile.fix_parents`` has been removed as a harmful API.
     ``VersionedFile.join`` will no longer accept different parents on either
     side of a join - it will either ignore them, or error, depending on the
     implementation. See notes when upgrading for more information.
     (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

   * ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.put_file`` now returns the number of bytes
     put by the method call, to allow avoiding stat-after-write or
     housekeeping in callers. (Robert Collins)

   * ``bzrlib.xml_serializer.Serializer`` is now responsible for checking that
     mandatory attributes are present on serialisation and deserialisation.
     This fixes some holes in API usage and allows better separation between
     physical storage and object serialisation. (Robert Collins)

   * New class ``bzrlib.errors.InternalBzrError`` which is just a convenient
     shorthand for deriving from BzrError and setting internal_error = True.
     (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.mutabletree.update_to_one_parent_via_delta`` for
     moving the state of a parent tree to a new version via a delta rather than
     a complete replacement tree. (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.osutils.minimum_path_selection`` useful for removing
     duplication from user input, when a user mentions both a path and an item
     contained within that path. (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.is_write_locked`` useful for
     determining if a repository is write locked. (Robert Collins)

   * New method on ``bzrlib.tree.Tree`` ``path_content_summary`` provides a
     tuple containing the key information about a path for commit processing
     to complete. (Robert Collins)

   * New method on xml serialisers, write_inventory_to_lines, which matches the
     API used by knits for adding content. (Robert Collins)

   * New module ``bzrlib.bisect_multi`` with generic multiple-bisection-at-once
     logic, currently only available for byte-based lookup
     (``bisect_multi_bytes``). (Robert Collins)

   * New helper ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.bytes_to_gzip`` which takes a byte string
     and returns a gzipped version of the same. This is used to avoid a bunch
     of api friction during adding of knit hunks. (Robert Collins)

   * New parameter on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.readv``
     ``adjust_for_latency`` which changes readv from returning strictly the
     requested data to inserted return larger ranges and in forward read order
     to reduce the effect of network latency. (Robert Collins)

   * New parameter yield_parents on ``Inventory.iter_entries_by_dir`` which
     causes the parents of a selected id to be returned recursively, so all the
     paths from the root down to each element of selected_file_ids are
     returned. (Robert Collins)

   * Knit joining has been enhanced to support plain to annotated conversion
     and annotated to plain conversion. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * The CommitBuilder method ``record_entry_contents`` now returns summary
     information about the effect of the commit on the repository. This tuple
     contains an inventory delta item if the entry changed from the basis, and a
     boolean indicating whether a new file graph node was recorded.
     (Robert Collins)

   * The python path used in the Makefile can now be overridden.
     (Andrew Bennetts, Ian Clatworthy)

  TESTING:

   * New transport implementation ``trace+`` which is useful for testing,
     logging activity taken to its _activity attribute. (Robert Collins)

   * When running bzr commands within the test suite, internal exceptions are
     not caught and reported in the usual way, but rather allowed to propagate
     up and be visible to the test suite.  A new API ``run_bzr_catch_user_errors``
     makes this behavior available to other users.
     (Martin Pool)

   * New method ``TestCase.call_catch_warnings`` for testing methods that 
     raises a Python warning.  (Martin Pool)

Hi,

we've just released another release of bzr-gtk, 0.92.0. This release
sports some major refactoring, fixes some bugs, and adds a couple more
UI bits and is intended to be compatible with Bazaar 0.92.

The changes since 0.91.0 are:

 UI

  * Removed email part of committer id from committer column in the
revision history window. (Daniel Schierbeck)

  * Removed date column from revision history window. (Daniel Schierbeck)

  * Rearranged the logview into a notebook. (Daniel Schierbeck)

  * Redesigned the Commit dialog. (John Arbash Meinel)

  * Broken lines support made optional. (Daniel Schierbeck)

 FEATURES

  * Rewrite of a large amount of the viz code:
        * Make use of the bzrlib.tsort.merge_sort for sorting the revisions.
        * A new algorithm to work out how to draw the lines using the
revsion numbers returned from merge_sort.
        * Lines that are very long are broken, which results in the
graph requiring less space to render and the graph is easier to
interpret. (#82907)
        * Choose the color for a branch from the revsion number, which
results in stable colors. Revisions on the mainline are allways black.
        * Implement a TreeModel that loads the revision data only when a
revision is scrolled into view, improving the time it takes to display
the first screen of data by 92%. (#124143)
        * Add a column to display the revision number. (#64167)
        * Add buttons to navigate to child revisions.
    (Gary van der Merwe)

  * Added a revert option to the revision menu. (Gary van der Merwe)

 BUG FIXES

  * Show children on new row in table to avoid very broad windows in
viz. (Jelmer)

  * viz slow when run from olive. (#70463, Gary van der Merwe)

  * Make it possible to open diff from the commit window when there are
pending merges. (Gary van der Merwe)

 INTERNALS

  * Use standard version tuple. (Jelmer)

  * Add check command to setup.py. (Jelmer)

  * Avoid deprecation warning for all_plugins() in gpreferences. (Jelmer)

 This release can be downloaded from:

 * https://launchpad.net/bzr-gtk/0.92/0.92.0/+download/bzr-gtk-0.92.0.tar.gz
(mirror: http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.92.0.tar.gz)

The tarball (the .tar.gz) has been signed with my GPG key (F1D076A3).
The signature can be downloaded from
http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.92.0.tar.gz.asc. To verify the
tarball, run:

$ gpg --verify bzr-gtk-0.92.0.tar.gz.asc

Bugs and requests for new features can be reported on launchpad,
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-gtk.

For the next release we're planning to enhance our test suite, and I'd
also like to include translations for Olive from Rosetta (the current
release doesn't contain any of them, since Launchpad wasn't able to
fulfill my export request in the last 12 hours).

At last but not at least, I'd like to thank to our contributors who
helped a lot to make this release happen. We're now using Bundle Buggy
to aid our development, and we hope that it helped producing better
quality code.

Enjoy!

Cheers,
Szilveszter / phanatic

I'm happy to announce the release of Bazaar 0.92, available now from

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download#preview

There are several fixes and improvements in this release, but the most
exciting is the new 'packs' format, accessible by the --format
knitpack1-experimental format to the bzr upgrade or init-repo.  Note
that before upgrading an existing repository to this format, you
should run 'bzr reconcile' on it.


bzr 0.92 2007-11-05
===================

  CHANGES:

  * New uninstaller on Win32.  (Alexander Belchenko)

bzr 0.92rc1 2007-10-29
======================

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

  CHANGES:

   * ``bzr`` now returns exit code 4 if an internal error occurred, and
     3 if a normal error occurred.  (Martin Pool)

   * ``pull``, ``merge`` and ``push`` will no longer silently correct some
     repository index errors that occured as a result of the Weave disk format.
     Instead the ``reconcile`` command needs to be run to correct those
     problems if they exist (and it has been able to fix most such problems
     since bzr 0.8). Some new problems have been identified during this release
     and you should run ``bzr check`` once on every repository to see if you
     need to reconcile. If you cannot ``pull`` or ``merge`` from a remote
     repository due to mismatched parent errors - a symptom of index errors -
     you should simply take a full copy of that remote repository to a clean
     directory outside any local repositories, then run reconcile on it, and
     finally pull from it locally. (And naturally email the repositories owner
     to ask them to upgrade and run reconcile).
     (Robert Collins)

  FEATURES:

   * New ``knitpack-experimental`` repository format. This is interoperable with
     the ``dirstate-tags`` format but uses a smarter storage design that greatly
     speeds up many operations, both local and remote. This new format can be
     used as an option to the ``init``, ``init-repository`` and ``upgrade``
     commands. See http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/developers/knitpack.html
     for further details. (Robert Collins)

   * For users of bzr-svn (and those testing the prototype subtree support) that
     wish to try packs, a new ``knitpack-subtree-experimental`` format has also
     been added. This is interoperable with the ``dirstate-subtrees`` format.
     (Robert Collins)

   * New ``reconfigure`` command. (Aaron Bentley)

   * New ``revert --forget-merges`` command, which removes the record
of a pending
     merge without affecting the working tree contents.  (Martin Pool)

   * New ``bzr_remote_path`` configuration variable allows finer control of
     remote bzr locations than BZR_REMOTE_PATH environment variable.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * New ``launchpad-login`` command to tell Bazaar your Launchpad
     user ID.  This can then be used by other functions of the
     Launchpad plugin. (James Henstridge)

  PERFORMANCE:

   * Commit in quiet mode is now slightly faster as the information to
     output is no longer calculated. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Commit no longer checks for new text keys during insertion when the
     revision id was deterministically unique. (Robert Collins)

   * Committing a change which is not a merge and does not change the number of
     files in the tree is faster by utilising the data about whether files are
     changed to determine if the tree is unchanged rather than recalculating
     it at the end of the commit process. (Robert Collins)

   * Inventory serialisation no longer double-sha's the content.
     (Robert Collins)

   * Knit text reconstruction now avoids making copies of the lines list for
     interim texts when building a single text. The new ``apply_delta`` method
     on ``KnitContent`` aids this by allowing modification of the revision id
     such objects represent. (Robert Collins)

   * Pack indices are now partially parsed for specific key lookup using a
     bisection approach. (Robert Collins)

   * Partial commits are now approximately 40% faster by walking over the
     unselected current tree more efficiently. (Robert Collins)

   * XML inventory serialisation takes 20% less time while being stricter about
     the contents. (Robert Collins)

   * Graph ``heads()`` queries have been fixed to no longer access all history
     unnecessarily. (Robert Collins)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * ``bzr+https://`` smart server across https now supported.
     (John Ferlito, Martin Pool, #128456)

   * Mutt is now a supported mail client; set ``mail_client=mutt`` in your
     bazaar.conf and ``send`` will use mutt. (Keir Mierle)

   * New option ``-c``/``--change`` for ``merge`` command for cherrypicking
     changes from one revision. (Alexander Belchenko, #141368)

   * Show encodings, locale and list of plugins in the traceback message.
     (Martin Pool, #63894)

   * Experimental directory formats can now be marked with
     ``experimental = True`` during registration. (Ian Clatworthy)

  DOCUMENTATION:

   * New *Bazaar in Five Minutes* guide.  (Matthew Revell)

   * The hooks reference documentation is now converted to html as expected.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

  BUG FIXES:

   * Connection error reporting for the smart server has been fixed to
     display a user friendly message instead of a traceback.
     (Ian Clatworthy, #115601)

   * Make sure to use ``O_BINARY`` when opening files to check their
     sha1sum. (Alexander Belchenko, John Arbash Meinel, #153493)

   * Fix a problem with Win32 handling of the executable bit.
     (John Arbash Meinel, #149113)

   * ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``sftp://`` URLs that do not specify ports explicitly
     no longer assume that means port 22.  This allows people using OpenSSH to
     override the default port in their ``~/.ssh/config`` if they wish.  This
     fixes a bug introduced in bzr 0.91.  (Andrew Bennetts, #146715)

   * Commands reporting exceptions can now be profiled and still have their
     data correctly dumped to a file. For example, a ``bzr commit`` with
     no changes still reports the operation as pointless but doing so no
     longer throws away the profiling data if this command is run with
     ``--lsprof-file callgrind.out.ci`` say. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Fallback to ftp when paramiko is not installed and sftp can't be used for
     ``tests/commands`` so that the test suite is still usable without
     paramiko.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #59150)

   * Fix commit ordering in corner case. (Aaron Bentley, #94975)

   * Fix long standing bug in partial commit when there are renames
     left in tree. (Robert Collins, #140419)

   * Fix selftest semi-random noise during http related tests.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140614)

   * Fix typo in ftp.py making the reconnection fail on temporary errors.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #154259)

   * Fix failing test by comparing real paths to cover the case where the TMPDIR
     contains a symbolic link.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #141382).

   * Fix log against smart server branches that don't support tags.
     (James Westby, #140615)

   * Fix pycurl http implementation by defining error codes from
     pycurl instead of relying on an old curl definition.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #147530)

   * Fix 'unprintable error' message when displaying BzrCheckError and
     some other exceptions on Python 2.5.
     (Martin Pool, #144633)

   * Fix ``Inventory.copy()`` and add test for it. (Jelmer Vernooij)

   * Handles default value for ListOption in cmd_commit.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140432)

   * HttpServer and FtpServer need to be closed properly or a listening socket
     will remain opened.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #140055)

   * Monitor the .bzr directory created in the top level test
     directory to detect leaking tests.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #147986)

   * The basename, not the full path, is now used when checking whether
     the profiling dump file begins with ``callgrind.out`` or not. This
     fixes a bug reported by Aaron Bentley on IRC. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Trivial fix for invoking command ``reconfigure`` without arguments.
     (Rob Weir, #141629)

   * ``WorkingTree.rename_one`` will now raise an error if normalisation of the
     new path causes bzr to be unable to access the file. (Robert Collins)

   * Correctly detect a NoSuchFile when using a filezilla server. (Gary van der
     Merwe)

  API BREAKS:

   * ``bzrlib.index.GraphIndex`` now requires a size parameter to the
     constructor, for enabling bisection searches. (Robert Collins)

   * ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` now requires the root entry of a
     tree be supplied to it, previously failing to do so would trigger a
     deprecation warning. (Robert Collins)

   * ``KnitVersionedFile.add*`` will no longer cache added records even when
     enable_cache() has been called - the caching feature is now exclusively for
     reading existing data. (Robert Collins)

   * ``ReadOnlyLockError`` is deprecated; ``LockFailed`` is usually more
     appropriate.  (Martin Pool)

   * Removed ``bzrlib.transport.TransportLogger`` - please see the new
     ``trace+`` transport instead. (Robert Collins)

   * Removed previously deprecated varargs interface to ``TestCase.run_bzr`` and
     deprecated methods ``TestCase.capture`` and ``TestCase.run_bzr_captured``.
     (Martin Pool)

   * Removed previous deprecated ``basis_knit`` parameter to the
     ``KnitVersionedFile`` constructor. (Robert Collins)

   * Special purpose method ``TestCase.run_bzr_decode`` is moved to
the test_non_ascii
     class that needs it.
     (Martin Pool)

   * The class ``bzrlib.repofmt.knitrepo.KnitRepository3`` has been folded into
     ``KnitRepository`` by parameters to the constructor. (Robert Collins)

   * The ``VersionedFile`` interface now allows content checks to be bypassed
     by supplying check_content=False.  This saves nearly 30% of the minimum
     cost to store a version of a file. (Robert Collins)

   * Tree's with bad state such as files with no length or sha will no longer
     be silently accepted by the repository XML serialiser. To serialise
     inventories without such data, pass working=True to write_inventory.
     (Robert Collins)

   * ``VersionedFile.fix_parents`` has been removed as a harmful API.
     ``VersionedFile.join`` will no longer accept different parents on either
     side of a join - it will either ignore them, or error, depending on the
     implementation. See notes when upgrading for more information.
     (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

   * ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.put_file`` now returns the number of bytes
     put by the method call, to allow avoiding stat-after-write or
     housekeeping in callers. (Robert Collins)

   * ``bzrlib.xml_serializer.Serializer`` is now responsible for checking that
     mandatory attributes are present on serialisation and deserialisation.
     This fixes some holes in API usage and allows better separation between
     physical storage and object serialisation. (Robert Collins)

   * New class ``bzrlib.errors.InternalBzrError`` which is just a convenient
     shorthand for deriving from BzrError and setting internal_error = True.
     (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.mutabletree.update_to_one_parent_via_delta`` for
     moving the state of a parent tree to a new version via a delta rather than
     a complete replacement tree. (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.osutils.minimum_path_selection`` useful for removing
     duplication from user input, when a user mentions both a path and an item
     contained within that path. (Robert Collins)

   * New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.is_write_locked`` useful for
     determining if a repository is write locked. (Robert Collins)

   * New method on ``bzrlib.tree.Tree`` ``path_content_summary`` provides a
     tuple containing the key information about a path for commit processing
     to complete. (Robert Collins)

   * New method on xml serialisers, write_inventory_to_lines, which matches the
     API used by knits for adding content. (Robert Collins)

   * New module ``bzrlib.bisect_multi`` with generic multiple-bisection-at-once
     logic, currently only available for byte-based lookup
     (``bisect_multi_bytes``). (Robert Collins)

   * New helper ``bzrlib.tuned_gzip.bytes_to_gzip`` which takes a byte string
     and returns a gzipped version of the same. This is used to avoid a bunch
     of api friction during adding of knit hunks. (Robert Collins)

   * New parameter on ``bzrlib.transport.Transport.readv``
     ``adjust_for_latency`` which changes readv from returning strictly the
     requested data to inserted return larger ranges and in forward read order
     to reduce the effect of network latency. (Robert Collins)

   * New parameter yield_parents on ``Inventory.iter_entries_by_dir`` which
     causes the parents of a selected id to be returned recursively, so all the
     paths from the root down to each element of selected_file_ids are
     returned. (Robert Collins)

   * Knit joining has been enhanced to support plain to annotated conversion
     and annotated to plain conversion. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * The CommitBuilder method ``record_entry_contents`` now returns summary
     information about the effect of the commit on the repository. This tuple
     contains an inventory delta item if the entry changed from the basis, and a
     boolean indicating whether a new file graph node was recorded.
     (Robert Collins)

   * The python path used in the Makefile can now be overridden.
     (Andrew Bennetts, Ian Clatworthy)

  TESTING:

   * New transport implementation ``trace+`` which is useful for testing,
     logging activity taken to its _activity attribute. (Robert Collins)

   * When running bzr commands within the test suite, internal exceptions are
     not caught and reported in the usual way, but rather allowed to propagate
     up and be visible to the test suite.  A new API
``run_bzr_catch_user_errors``
     makes this behavior available to other users.
     (Martin Pool)

   * New method ``TestCase.call_catch_warnings`` for testing methods that
     raises a Python warning.  (Martin Pool)

Windows installers for 0.92 already on the site,
links for download available on the page above.

I believe that we still use --format knitpack-experimental (without `1`).

Actually, python-based installers for Windows now provide uninstall shortcut
in Start - Programs - Bazaar menu, in addition to usual way via
Start - Settings - Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs

Enjoy!

- From behalf of QBzr team I'm pleased to announce release of QBzr 0.7.0.
This release contains several bug fixes and improvements.

Download
========
Source code tarball:
    https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.7.0/+download/qbzr-0.7.0.tar.gz
Windows installer (for version of QBzr compatible with stndalone bzr.exe):
    https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.7.0/+download/qbzr-setup-0.7.0.exe

Changes
=======
* Added version info for 'bzr plugins'.
 * Gettext support.
 * Remember window sizes and states. (#148157)
 * qdiff:
    * New command line option '-c'.
    * Optional unified diff view.
    * Use per-branch 'encoding' option to decode source code. (#148159)
 * qlog:
    * Display text with the right color for selected lines with
      tags/bugs. (#147998)
    * Use os.startfile to open external links if the webbrowser module
      is not available. (#148002)
    * Add the Diff button in the Log dialog.
    * Display only the committer/author name in revision lists.
 * qcommit:
    * Fixed commit with pending merges. (#148849)
    * Allow reverting and viewing changes of multiple files in qcommit.
    * Double click on a pending merged revision will show the changes.
    * Fixed pre-selecting of files specified on the command line.

More about gettext support (i18n)
=================================
Files with strings translations are not included to release (for some reason),
but will be included in next releases (I believe).
Now you can download current set of translations (aka mo-files) and unpack
it to directory where you're installed QBzr plugin:
    http://bialix.com/qbzr/qbzr-locale.zip

Currently there are 3 translations for:
Slovak, Russian and Ukrainian languages.

Want to use QBzr with your native language? Let's translate it!
The better way now is to use PO-files directly, because Rosetta
service at Launchpad has very serious performance problems
(I believe these problems will be fixed soon, stay tuned).

Alexander

P.S. Release was done by Luk Lalinsk, the author of QBzr.
Luk, I hope you don't mind that I did announcement?

Hi,

I just released bzr-config 0.92.0.
No code was changed, only translations updated.

This is the last release of bzr-config utility.
Development is suspended, because similar
functionality is available in others Bazaar GUI
plugins:

* bzr-gtk has gpreference command
* QBzr has qconfig command (will appear in next 0.8.0 release of Qbzr).

Files available at Launchpad page:

https://launchpad.net/bzr-config/+download

Alexander.

This should say "switch", not "shelf".

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.0.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.0 Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- Shelf is no longer included (now provided by Bazaar itself)
- Miscellaneous cleanups

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.0.0 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-1.0.0.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-1.0.0.tar.gz.sig

Note that because the version number has jumped, bzrtools will refuse to
operate with Bazaar 0.92.

Enjoy!

Aaron

Hi,

we've just released another release of bzr-gtk, 0.93.0. This release
features a menubar added to 'bzr viz', fixes some bugs, and is intended
to be compatible with Bazaar 1.0.

The changes since 0.92.1 are:

 UI

  * Added a menu bar to the viz. (Daniel Schierbeck)
     - Select a revision by tag.
     - Show/hide tree view columns.

 BUG FIXES

  * Make toolbars in Olive follow GNOME standards. (#137074)

 INTERNALS

  * Allow test suite to run without PyGTK. (Aaron Bentley)

This release can be downloaded from:

 * https://launchpad.net/bzr-gtk/0.93/0.93.0/+download/bzr-gtk-0.93.0.tar.gz
(mirror: http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.93.0.tar.gz)

The tarball (the .tar.gz) has been signed with my GPG key (F1D076A3).
The signature can be downloaded from
http://phanatic.hu/bzr-gtk/bzr-gtk-0.93.0.tar.gz.asc. To verify the
tarball, run:

$ gpg --verify bzr-gtk-0.93.0.tar.gz.asc

Bugs and requests for new features can be reported on launchpad,
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-gtk.

Q: Why 0.93 instead of 1.0?

A: The reason is really simple. Bazaar and bzr-gtk are two different
products. We've been trying too keep up with the Bazaar releases due to
possible API incompatibilities. With Bazaar 1.0 this issue should go
away, so we (the bzr-gtk crew) decided to follow our own way from now
on, and we think that our software is not yet ready to be released as
1.0. Our release notes always contained information about the compatible
Bazaar versions, and we'll continue to do so.

We would like to congratulate the Bazaar folks for achieving this great
milestone!

Enjoy!

Cheers,
Szilveszter / phanatic

I'm very happy to announce the 1.0 release of the Bazaar version
control system.  Bazaar  works on Unix, Windows, and Mac; adapts
flexibly to different development models; correctly tracks file and
directory renames; and is easy to learn and use.

The Bazaar source, which works on any system with Python2.4 or later,
can be downloaded from

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/releases/src/bzr-1.0.tar.gz

   * Improve bug tracker integration documentation. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Minor edits to ``Bazaar in five minutes`` from David Roberts and

  CHANGES:

   * If a traceback occurs, users are now asked to report the bug
     through Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/), rather than
     by mail to the mailing list.
     (Martin Pool)

  BUGFIXES:

   * Fix Makefile rules for doc generation. (Ian Clatworthy, #175207)

   * Give more feedback during long http downloads by making readv deliver =
data
     as it arrives for urllib, and issue more requests for pycurl. High lat=
ency
     networks are better handled by urllib, the pycurl implementation give =
more
     feedback but also incur more latency.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #173010)

   * Implement _make_parents_provider on RemoteRepository, allowing generat=
ing
     bundles against branches on a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #147836=
)

  DOCUMENTATION:

   * Improved user guide.  (Ian Clatworthy)

   * The single-page quick reference guide is now available as a PDF.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

  INTERNALS:

    * readv urllib http implementation is now a real iterator above the
      underlying socket and deliver data as soon as it arrives. 'get' still
      wraps its output in a StringIO.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * Added a --coverage option to selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

   * ``bzr commit`` now doesn't print the revision number twice. (Matt
     Nordhoff, #172612)

   * New configuration option ``bugtracker_<tracker_abbrevation>_url`` to
     define locations of bug trackers that are not directly supported by
     bzr or a plugin. The URL will be treated as a template and ``{id}``
     placeholders will be replaced by specific bug IDs.  (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=
=FD)

   * Support logging single merge revisions with short and line log formatt=
ers.
     (Kent Gibson)

   * User Guide enhanced with suggested readability improvements from
     Matt Revell and corrections from John Arbash Meinel. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Quick Start Guide renamed to Quick Start Card, moved down in
     the catalog, provided in pdf and png format and updated to refer
     to ``send`` instead of ``bundle``. (Ian Clatworthy, #165080)

   * ``switch`` can now be used on heavyweight checkouts as well as
     lightweight ones. After switching a heavyweight checkout, the
     local branch is a mirror/cache of the new bound branch and
     uncommitted changes in the working tree are merged. As a safety
     check, if there are local commits in a checkout which have not
     been committed to the previously bound branch, then ``switch``
     fails unless the ``--force`` option is given. This option is
     now also required if the branch a lightweight checkout is pointing
     to has been moved. (Ian Clatworthy)

  INTERNALS:

    * New -Dhttp debug option reports http connections, requests and respon=
ses.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * New -Dmerge debug option, which emits merge plans for merge-type=3Dwe=
ave.

  BUGFIXES:

   * Better error message when running ``bzr cat`` on a non-existant branch=
.
     (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #133782)

   * Catch OSError 17 (file exists) in final phase of tree transform and sh=
ow
     filename to user.
     (Alexander Belchenko, #111758)

   * Catch ShortReadvErrors while using pycurl. Also make readv more robust=
 by
     allowing multiple GET requests to be issued if too many ranges are
     required.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #172701)

   * Check for missing basis texts when fetching from packs to packs.
     (John Arbash Meinel, #165290)

   * Fall back to showing e-mail in ``log --short/--line`` if the
     committer/author has only e-mail. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #157026)

  API BREAKS:

   * Deprecate not passing a ``location`` argument to commit reporters'
     ``started`` methods. (Matt Nordhoff)


bzr 1.0rc1 2007-11-30
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

   * The default repository format is now ``pack-0.92``.  This
     default is used when creating new repositories with ``init`` and
     ``init-repo``, and when branching over bzr+ssh or bzr+hpss.
     (See https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/164626)

     This format can be read and written by Bazaar 0.92 and later, and
     data can be transferred to and from older formats.

     To upgrade, please reconcile your repository (``bzr reconcile``), and =
then
     upgrade (``bzr upgrade``).

     ``pack-0.92`` offers substantially better scaling and performance than=
 the
     previous knits format. Some operations are slower where the code alrea=
dy
     had bad scaling characteristics under knits, the pack format makes suc=
h
     operations more visible as part of being more scalable overall. We wil=
l
     correct such operations over the coming releases and encourage the fil=
ing
     of bugs on any operation which you observe to be slower in a packs
     repository. One particular case that we do not intend to fix is pullin=
g
     data from a pack repository into a knit repository over a high latency
     link;  downgrading such data requires reinsertion of the file texts, a=
nd
     this is a classic space/time tradeoff. The current implementation is
     conservative on memory usage because we need to support converting dat=
a
     from any tree without problems.
     (Robert Collins, Martin Pool, #164476)

  CHANGES:

   * Disable detection of plink.exe as possible ssh vendor. Plink vendor
     still available if user selects it explicitly with BZR_SSH environment
     variable. (Alexander Belchenko, workaround for bug #107593)

   * The pack format is now accessible as "pack-0.92", or "pack-0.92-subtre=
e"
     to enable the subtree functions (for example, for bzr-svn).
     See http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/developer/packrepo.html
     (Martin Pool)

  FEATURES:

   * New ``authentication.conf`` file holding the password or other credent=
ials
     for remote servers. This can be used for ssh, sftp, smtp and other
     supported transports.
     (Vincent Ladeuil)

   * New rich-root and rich-root-pack formats, recording the same data abou=
t
     tree roots that's recorded for all other directories.
     (Aaron Bentley, #164639)

   * ``pack-0.92`` repositories can now be reconciled.
     (Robert Collins, #154173)

   * ``switch`` command added for changing the branch a lightweight checkou=
t
     is associated with and updating the tree to reflect the latest content
     accordingly. This command was previously part of the BzrTools plug-in.
     (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley, David Allouche)

   * ``reconfigure`` command can now convert branches, trees, or checkouts =
to
     lightweight checkouts.  (Aaron Bentley)

  PERFORMANCE:

   * Commit updates the state of the working tree via a delta rather than
     supplying entirely new basis trees. For commit of a single specified f=
ile
     this reduces the wall clock time for commit by roughly a 30%.
     (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

   * Commit with many automatically found deleted paths no longer performs
     linear scanning for the children of those paths during inventory
     iteration. This should fix commit performance blowing out when many su=
ch
     paths occur during commit. (Robert Collins, #156491)

   * Fetch with pack repositories will no longer read the entire history gr=
aph.
     (Robert Collins, #88319)

   * Revert takes out an appropriate lock when reverting to a basis tree, a=
nd
     does not read the basis inventory twice. (Robert Collins)

   * Diff does not require an inventory to be generated on dirstate trees.
     (Aaron Bentley, #149254)

   * New annotate merge (--merge-type=3Dweave) implementation is fast on
     versionedfiles withough cached annotations, e.g. pack-0.92.
     (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * ``bzr merge`` now warns when it encounters a criss-cross merge.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``bzr send`` now doesn't require the target e-mail address to be
     specified on the command line if an interactive e-mail client is used.
     (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * ``bzr tags`` now prints the revision number for each tag, instead of
     the revision id, unless --show-ids is passed. In addition, tags can be
     sorted chronologically instead of lexicographically with --sort=3Dtime=
.
     (Adeodato Sim=F3, #120231)

   * Windows standalone version of bzr is able to load system-wide plugins =
from
     "plugins" subdirectory in installation directory. In addition standalo=
ne
     installer write to the registry (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Bazaar) useful info
     about paths and bzr version. (Alexander Belchenko, #129298)

  DOCUMENTATION:

  BUG FIXES:

   * A progress bar has been added for knitpack -> knitpack fetching.
     (Robert Collins, #157789, #159147)

   * Branching from a branch via smart server now preserves the repository
     format. (Andrew Bennetts,  #164626)

   * ``commit`` is now able to invoke an external editor in a non-ascii
     directory. (Daniel Watkins, #84043)

   * Catch connection errors for ftp.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #164567)

   * ``check`` no longer reports spurious unreferenced text versions.

     on them.
     (Martin Pool, #164637)

     strings now should be readable in non-utf-8 terminal.
     (Alexander Belchenko, #54173)

   * The error message when ``move --after`` should be used makes how to do=
 so
     clearer. (Daniel Watkins, #85237)

   * Unicode-safe output from ``bzr info``. The output will be encoded
     using the terminal encoding and unrepresentable characters will be
     replaced by '?'. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #151844)

   * Working trees are no longer created when pushing into a local no-trees
     repo. (Daniel Watkins, #50582)

   * Wrap medusa ftp test server as an FTPServer feature.

  API BREAKS:

   * ``osutils.backup_file`` is deprecated. Actually it's not used in bzrli=
b
     during very long time. (Alexander Belchenko)

   * The return value of
     ``VersionedFile.iter_lines_added_or_present_in_versions`` has been
     changed. Previously it was an iterator of lines, now it is an iterator=
 of
     (line, version_id) tuples. This change has been made to aid reconcile =
and
     fetch operations. (Robert Collins)

   * ``bzrlib.repository.get_versioned_file_checker`` is now private.
     (Robert Collins)

   * The Repository format registry default has been removed; it was previo=
usly
     obsoleted by the bzrdir format default, which implies a default reposi=
tory
     format.
     (Martin Pool)

  INTERNALS:

   * Added ``ContainerSerialiser`` and ``ContainerPushParser`` to
     ``bzrlib.pack``.  These classes provide more convenient APIs for gener=
ating
     and parsing containers from streams rather than from files.  (Andrew
     Bennetts)

   * New module ``lru_cache`` providing a cache for use by tasks that need
     semi-random access to large amounts of data. (John A Meinel)

   * InventoryEntry.diff is now deprecated.  Please use diff.DiffTree inste=
ad.

Hi,

I've just uploaded a disk image that features Bazaar 1.0 final installer
for the Mac platform.

There's a wiki page dedicated to the installer:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/MacOSXBundle

Some highlights from that page...

Contents of the package:
 - Bazaar 1.0 (library and executable)
 - PyCrypto 2.0.1 and Paramiko 1.7.1
 - BzrTools 1.0.0
 - QBzr 0.8.0
 - Rebase plugin 0.3
 - Documentation in PDF format (installed as well, but can be accessed
from the disk image directly)

Download:

Currently I'm hosting the disk image on my own site (not sure about
Launchpad accepting 38 MB files).

http://phanatic.hu/bzr/mac/Bazaar-1.0-OSX10.5.dmg
(MD5: b0606cb53463d027363619fc587c3545)

A quick FAQ:

Q: You said you'll ship bzr-svn, but I can't see it. What happened?
A: Leopard ships with Subversion 1.4.4, that doesn't have the patch
applied, which is needed by bzr-svn to work properly. I'm still
investigating the possibility of building a binary installer for a
patched Subversion based on the existing work of the svnbinaries
community. You can expect such an installer for the next Bazaar release
(hopefully).

Q: I'm running a rock solid version of OS X, which is Tiger. Why Leopard
only?
A: I have only one machine that runs Leopard. Unfortunately OS X is not
that kind of OS, which can be run in a VMware environment to deploy
binaries for different platforms.

Q: I don't want to depend on your free time, and/or want to have a
slightly modified version of the installer, what can I do?
A: The installer creation process will be documented in the wiki. It's
still under construction, but you can have a look at it here:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/MacOSXBundle/Prepare

If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reply to this
message, or to contact me directly.

Any help is appreciated of course (especially building a patched
Subversion installer would be cool). Just drop me a line, if you're
working on something, so we can collaborate.

Enjoy,
Szilveszter / phanatic

I'm happy to announce a candidate for the next release of Bazaar.
This release contains substantial improvements to diff, merge,
annotate, the http transport, and many other areas.  Full details are
below.

Please install and test this release and let us know if you encounter
any problems.  We expect to announce the 1.1 final on the 11th of
January with few changes from this rc.  Packages and installers for
various operating systems should be available shortly.

Download from:

  https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.1/1.1rc1

Thanks to everyone who contributed code, bug reports, suggestions,
documentation or support for this release.

bzr 1.1rc1 2008-01-05
---------------------

  CHANGES:

   * The syntax ``bzr diff branch1 branch2`` is no longer supported.
     Use ``bzr diff branch1 --new branch2`` instead. This change has
     been made to remove the ambiguity where ``branch2`` is in fact a
     specific file to diff within ``branch1``.

  FEATURES:

   * New option to use custom template-based formats in  ``bzr version-info=
``.
     (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * diff '--using' allows an external diff tool to be used for files.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * New "lca" merge-type for fast everyday merging that also supports
     criss-cross merges.  (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

   * ``annotate`` now doesn't require a working tree. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD=
,
     #90049)

   * ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can now use files from a working tree to
     to speed up the process.  For checkout, this requires the new
     --files-from flag.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``bzr diff`` now sorts files in alphabetical order.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``bzr diff`` now works on branches without working trees. Tree-less
     branches can also be compared to each other and to working trees using
     the new diff options ``--old`` and ``--new``. Diffing between branches=
,
     with or without trees, now supports specific file filtering as well.
     (Ian Clatworthy, #6700)

   * ``bzr pack`` now orders revision texts in topological order, with newe=
st
     at the start of the file, promoting linear reads for ``bzr log`` and t=
he
     like. This partially fixes #154129. (Robert Collins)

   * Merge directives now fetch prerequisites from the target branch if
     needed.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * pycurl now handles digest authentication.
     (Vincent Ladeuil)

   * ``reconfigure`` can now convert from repositories.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``-l`` is now a short form for ``--limit`` in ``log``.  (Matt Nordhoff=
)

   * ``merge`` now warns when merge directives cause cherrypicks.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``split`` now supported, to enable splitting large trees into smaller
     pieces.  (Aaron Bentley)

  BUGFIXES:

   * Better handle short reads when processing multiple range requests.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #179368)

   * build_tree acceleration uses the correct path when a file has been mov=
ed.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``commit`` now succeeds when a checkout and its master branch share a
     repository.  (Aaron Bentley, #177592)

   * Fixed error reporting of unsupported timezone format in
     ``log --timezone``. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #178722)

   * Fixed Unicode encoding error in ``ignored`` when the output is
     redirected to a pipe. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

   * Fix traceback when sending large response bodies over the smart protoc=
ol
     on Windows. (Andrew Bennetts, #115781)

   * Fix ``urlutils.relative_url`` for the case of two ``file:///`` URLs
     pointed to different logical drives on Windows.
     (Alexander Belchenko, #90847)

   * HTTP test servers are now compatible with the http protocol version 1.=
1.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #175524)

   * _KnitParentsProvider.get_parent_map now handles requests for ghosts
     correctly, instead of erroring or attributing incorrect parents to gho=
sts.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * ``merge --weave --uncommitted`` now works.  (Aaron Bentley)

   * pycurl authentication handling was broken and incomplete. Fix handling=
 of
     user:pass embedded in the urls.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #177643)

   * Files inside non-directories are now handled like other conflict types=
.
     (Aaron Bentley, #177390)

   * ``reconfigure`` is able to convert trees into lightweight checkouts.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * Reduce lockdir timeout to 0 when running ``bzr serve``.  (Andrew Benne=
tts,
     #148087)

   * Test that the old ``version_info_format`` functions still work, even
     though they are deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel, ShenMaq, #177872)

   * Transform failures no longer cause ImmortalLimbo errors (Aaron Bentley=
,
     #137681)

   * ``uncommit`` works even when the commit messages of revisions to be
     removed use characters not supported in the terminal encoding.
     (Aaron Bentley)

   * When dumb http servers return whole files instead of the requested ran=
ges,
     read the remaining bytes by chunks to avoid overflowing network buffer=
s.
     (Vincent Ladeuil, #175886)

  DOCUMENTATION:

   * Minor tweaks made to the bug tracker integration documentation.
     (Ian Clatworthy)

   * Reference material has now be moved out of the User Guide and added
     to the User Reference. The User Reference has gained 4 sections as
     a result: Authenication Settings, Configuration Settings, Conflicts
     and Hooks. All help topics are now dumped into text format in the
     doc/en/user-reference directory for those who like browsing that
     information in their editor. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * *Using Bazaar with Launchpad* tutorial added. (Ian Clatworthy)

  INTERNALS:

    * find_* methods available for BzrDirs, Branches and WorkingTrees.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Help topics can now be loaded from files.
      (Ian Clatworthy, Alexander Belchenko)

    * get_parent_map now always provides tuples as its output.  (Aaron Bent=
ley)

    * Parent Providers should now implement ``get_parent_map`` returning a
      dictionary instead of ``get_parents`` returning a list.
      ``get_parents`` is now considered deprecated.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Patience Diff now supports arbitrary python objects, as long as they
      support ``hash()``. (John Arbash Meinel)

  API BREAKS:

  TESTING:

   * Modules can now customise their tests by defining a ``load_tests``
     attribute. ``pydoc bzrlib.tests.TestUtil.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModul=
e``
     for the documentation on this attribute. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_id_re`` which helps
     filter tests based on a regular expression search on the tests id.
     (Robert Collins)

   * New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.condition_isinstance`` which helps
     filter tests based on class. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_suite_by_condition`` which
     generalises the ``exclude_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper function ``bzrlib.tests.filter_suite_by_condition`` which
     generalises the ``filter_suite_by_re`` function. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.exclude_tests_by_re`` which gives a n=
ew
     TestSuite that does not contain tests from the input that matched a
     regular expression. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.randomize_suite`` which returns a
     randomized copy of the input suite. (Robert Collins)

   * New helper method ``bzrlib.tests.split_suite_by_re`` which splits a te=

Whoops, I'll try to remember to sign it next time. I usually just copy
my previous email and replace a couple of things... problem is I don't
always send the announcement from a trusted machine, so I don't always
have access to my GPG key.

Adding Frisian to the list of languages in your spell checker should
fix that :-)

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.1.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.1.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- "cbranch" uses related trees to accelerate checkout, just like
  "branch" and "checkout" do.  cbranch also accepts a --files-from
  parameter
- "branches" and "multi-pull" use the new find_branches APIs
- new "trees" command to list trees under a URL
- rspush supports branch6 formats, e.g. 'dirstate-tags', 'pack-0.92'

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.1.0 is available at:
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-1.1.0.tar.gz
http://panoramicfeedback.com/opensource/bzrtools-1.1.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

I'm happy to announce the 1.1 release of the Bazaar version control
system.  This release consolidates the changes in 1.0, and also
contains substantial improvements to diff, merge, annotate, the http
transport, and many other areas.

This release is functionally identical with the 1.1 release candidate
of last week, whose changelog is shown below.

Thanks to everyone who contributed changes, suggestions, bug fixes or
reports.  They're much appreciated by Bazaar developers and users.

Download the source now from:

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

Packages and installers will follow soon.

I'm happy to announce bzr-loom.

bzr-loom is a plugin for Bazaar which adds support for maintaining a
stack of related threads.  Looms are good for working on several
separate, but related features: for example, refactoring to facilitate a
new feature, and then developing the feature on top of that refactoring.

The loom plugin is released under the GNU GPL v2.

The launchpad URL is https://launchpad.net/bzr-loom/.

To get a copy of the looms development branch, 'bzr branch lp:bzr-loom',
or for the 1.2 release, 'bzr branch lp:bzr-loom/1.2'.

Looms are eminently usable today, though there is plenty for
contributors to do.

Discussion and further development of looms will take place on the main
bzr mailing list, <bazaar@lists.canonical.com>

-Rob

I'm pleased to announce bzr-fastimport, a plugin useful for loading data
exported by a large number of foreign VCS tools. Places to start are:

* the Launchpad page - https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport
* the Wiki page - http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport.

Please note that this is not yet production quality but seems to be
working well enough to be useful for a large number of projects.

I would *greatly* appreciate testing, feedback and improvements. In
particular, I'm using this for migrating the OpenOffice.org repository
(76K files and 500K revisions) into Bazaar from Subversion, so I'd
really like some help with testing out and enhancing the existing
Subversion front-ends.

Enjoy,
Ian C.

 I'm happy to announce that Bazaar is now officially a GNU project.

 This decision was taken after consultation with some of the core
 Bazaar developers, Canonical management, and Richard Stallman, leader
 of the GNU project.

 If we can help other GNU projects, by extending Bazaar to meet their
 needs or in other ways we will.  Over time we will come into more
 compliance with the GNU technical and process standards, by sending
 patches through the regular review process.  Our review process, and
 licence will remain the same, and copyright will still be held by
 Canonical under the current agreement with contributors.

 Bazaar is already supported on savanah.gnu.org, the Free Software
 Foundation's project hosting server, as well as on Canonical's
 Launchpad.net development nexus.

Canonical is delighted by the GNU project's decision and remains as
engaged as ever in the Bazaar project.  We think Bazaar is a great
tool, we like using it for many of our projects, including Launchpad
and Ubuntu.  Andrew, Ian, John,
Robert and myself will still be actively working on developing Bazaar,
and indeed meeting next week with some of our most active
co-developers in London.

I'm happy to announce the release of version 1.3 of the Bazaar version
control system.

  http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

Since 1.2, we've improved the speed of several important operations,
including log, annotate, and other operations on revision history.
Several bugs have been fixed and new options and features have been
added, including an option to hardlink files between working trees.  A
full history of changes is listed below.

In this release, Bazaar becomes part of the GNU system.  This decision
was taken after consultation with some of the core Bazaar developers,
Canonical management, and Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU project.
 Canonical is delighted by the GNU project's decision and remains as
engaged as ever in the Bazaar project.

bzr 1.3 2008-03-20
------------------


  TESTING:

    * Avoid spurious failure of ``TestVersion.test_version`` matching
      directory names.
      (#202778, Martin Pool)

bzr 1.3rc1 2008-03-16
---------------------

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * The backup directory created by ``upgrade`` is now called
      ``backup.bzr``, not ``.bzr.backup``. (Martin Albisetti)

  CHANGES:

    * A new repository format 'development' has been added. This format will
      represent the latest 'in-progress' format that the bzr developers are
      interested in getting early-adopter testing and feedback on.
      ``doc/developers/development-repo.txt`` has detailed information.
      (Robert Collins)

    * BZR_LOG environment variable controls location of .bzr.log trace file.
      User can suppress writing messages to .bzr.log by using '/dev/null'
      filename (on Linux) or 'NUL' (on Windows). If BZR_LOG variable
      is not defined but BZR_HOME is defined then default location
      for .bzr.log trace file is ``$BZR_HOME/.bzr.log``.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``launchpad`` builtin plugin now shipped as separate part in standalone
      bzr.exe, installed to ``C:\Program Files\Bazaar\plugins`` directory,
      and standalone installer allows user to skip installation of this plugin.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Restore auto-detection of plink.exe on Windows. (Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Version number is now shown as "1.2" or "1.2pr2", without zeroed or
      missing final fields.  (Martin Pool)

  FEATURES:

    * ``branch`` and ``checkout`` can hard-link working tree files, which is
      faster and saves space.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr send`` will now also look at the ``child_submit_to`` setting in
      the submit branch to determine the email address to send to.
      (Jelmer Vernooij)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * BzrBranch._lefthand_history is faster on pack repos.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Branch6.generate_revision_history is faster.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Directory services can now be registered, allowing special URLs to be
      dereferenced into real URLs.  This is a generalization and cleanup of
      the lp: transport lookup.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Merge directives that are automatically attached to emails have nicer
      filenames, based on branch-nick + revno. (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``push`` has a ``--revision`` option, to specify what revision to push up
      to.  (Daniel Watkins)

    * Significantly reducing execution time and network traffic for trivial
      case of running ``bzr missing`` command for two identical branches.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * Speed up operations that look at the revision graph (such as 'bzr log').
      ``KnitPackRepositor.get_revision_graph`` uses ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` to
      extract the revision history. This allows filtering ghosts while
      stepping instead of needing to peek ahead. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The ``hooks`` command lists installed hooks, to assist in debugging.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * Updates to how ``annotate`` work. Should see a measurable improvement in
      performance and memory consumption for file with a lot of merges.
      Also, correctly handle when a line is introduced by both parents (it
      should be attributed to the first merge which notices this, and not
      to all subsequent merges.) (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Autopacking no longer holds the full set of inventory lines in
      memory while copying. For large repositories, this can amount to
      hundreds of MB of ram consumption.
      (Ian Clatworthy, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Cherrypicking when using ``--format=merge3`` now explictly excludes
      BASE lines. (John Arbash Meinel, #151731)

    * Disable plink's interactive prompt for password.
      (#107593, Dmitry Vasiliev)

    * Encode command line arguments from unicode to user_encoding before
      invoking external mail client in `bzr send` command.
      (#139318, Alexander Belchenko)

    * Fixed problem connecting to ``bzr+https://`` servers.
      (#198793, John Ferlito)

    * Improved error reporting in the Launchpad plugin. (Daniel Watkins,
      #196618)

    * Include quick-start-summary.svg file to python-based installer(s)
      for Windows. (#192924, Alexander Belchenko)

    * lca merge now respects specified files. (Aaron Bentley)

    * Make version-info --custom imply --all. (#195560, James Westby)

    * ``merge --preview`` now works for merges that add or modify
      symlinks (James Henstridge)

    * Redirecting the output from ``bzr merge`` (when the remembered
      location is used) now works. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * setup.py script explicitly checks for Python version.
      (Jari Aalto, Alexander Belchenko, #200569)

    * UnknownFormatErrors no longer refer to branches regardless of kind of
      unknown format. (Daniel Watkins, #173980)

    * Upgrade bundled ConfigObj to version 4.5.2, which properly quotes #
      signs, among other small improvements. (Matt Nordhoff, #86838)

    * Use correct indices when emitting LCA conflicts.  This fixes IndexError
      errors.  (Aaron Bentley, #196780)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Explained how to use ``version-info --custom`` in the User Guide.
      (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

  API BREAKS:

    * Support for loading plugins from zip files and
      ``bzrlib.plugin.load_from_zip()`` function are deprecated.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

  TESTING:

    * The branch interface tests were invalid for branches using rich-root
      repositories because the empty string is not a valid file-id.
      (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` returns the ancestry of revision ids. Similar to
      ``Repository.get_revision_graph()`` except it includes ghosts and you can
      stop part-way through. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``Graph.iter_ancestry`` returns the ancestry of revision ids. Similar to
      ``Repository.get_revision_graph()`` except it includes ghosts and you can
      stop part-way through. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New module ``tools/package_mf.py`` provide custom module finder for
      python packages (improves standard python library's modulefinder.py)
      used by ``setup.py`` script while building standalone bzr.exe.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * New remote method ``RemoteBzrDir.find_repositoryV2`` adding support for
      detecting external lookup support on remote repositories. This method is
      now attempted first when lookup up repositories, leading to an extra
      round trip on older bzr smart servers. (Robert Collins)

    * Repository formats have a new supported-feature attribute
      ``supports_external_lookups`` used to indicate repositories which support
      falling back to other repositories when they have partial data.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``Repository.get_revision_graph_with_ghosts`` and
      ``bzrlib.revision.(common_ancestor,MultipleRevisionSources,common_graph)``
      have been deprecated.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``Tree.iter_changes`` is now a public API, replacing the work-in-progress
      ``Tree._iter_changes``. The api is now considered stable and ready for
      external users.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * The bzrdir format registry now accepts an ``alias`` keyword to
      register_metadir, used to indicate that a format name is an alias for
      some other format and thus should not be reported when describing the
      format. (Robert Collins)

bzr-loom 1.3 is now released.=20

This release has better error messages, a new export-loom command,
support for merge types such as lca during up-thread operations.

bzr-loom is a plugin for Bazaar which adds support for maintaining a
stack of related threads. Looms are good for working on several
separate, but related features: for example, refactoring to facilitate a
new feature, and then developing the feature on top of that refactoring.

The loom plugin is released under the GNU GPL v2.

To get a copy of the looms 1.3 release, 'bzr branch lp:bzr-loom/1.3'.

Discussion and further development of looms will take place on the main
bzr mailing list, <bazaar@lists.canonical.com>.

I'll upload a version of bzr-svn to the the hardy PPA later today.

I have no plans to upload bzr-dbus or bzr-gtk to ppa since they're not
tied to a particular bzr release (unlike bzrtools and bzr-svn).

Cheers,

This is to announce the release of Bazaar 1.3.1, a bugfix release.

This release has only one change from the 1.3 release of March, which
is a fix for <http://launchpad.net/bugs/208418>.  This bug caused a
ValueError when transferring data between knit and pack format
repositories.

Upgrading from 1.3 is only necessary for people experiencing this
problem.  The next major release of Bazaar, 1.4, will be available in
approximately one week, containing more improvements and fixes.

Available now from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.4.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.4.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
"graph-ancestry" now uses the Graph API, and properly escapes commit
messages for HTML output.
"patch" now emits nicer errors
"cbranch" now creates any number of missing parent directories.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.4.0 is available at:
http://code.launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.4.0/+download/bzrtools-1.4.0.tar.gz
http://code.launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.4.0/+download/bzrtools-1.4.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

On behalf of the developers of the Bazaar version control system I'd
like to announce our 1.4 release, available now from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download/>

Thanks very much to all the people who contributed patches, bug reports,
suggestions and feedback for this release.

Martin



bzr 1.4 2008-04-28
------------------

This release of Bazaar includes handy improvements to the speed of log and
status, new options for several commands, improved documentation, and better
hooks, including initial code for server-side hooks.  A number of bugs have
been fixed, particularly in interoperability between different formats or
different releases of Bazaar over there network.  There's been substantial
internal work in both the repository and network code to enable new features
and faster performance.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would br=
eak
      if the remote server was < version 1.2.  This was due to a bug in the
      RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Andrew Bennetts, #214894)


bzr 1.4rc2 2008-04-21
---------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr log -r ..X bzr://`` was failing, because it was getting a reque=
st
      for ``revision_id=3DNone`` which was not a string.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #211661)

    * Fixed a bug in handling ghost revisions when logging changes in a=20
      particular file.  (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

    * Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
      (Andrew Bennetts, #205156)

    * Fixed performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories to
      knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on every gra=
ph
      walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph API.  There was
      another regression in knit =3D> knit fetching which re-read the index=
 for
      every revision each side had in common.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)


bzr 1.4rc1 2008-04-11
---------------------

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

  CHANGES:

   * bzr main script cannot be imported (Benjamin Peterson)

   * On Linux bzr additionally looks for plugins in arch-independent site
     directory. (Toshio Kuratomi)

   * The ``set_rh`` branch hook is now deprecated. Please migrate
     any plugins using this hook to use an alternative, e.g.
     ``post_change_branch_tip``. (Ian Clatworthy)

   * When a plugin cannot be loaded as the file path is not a valid
     python module name bzr will now strip a ``bzr_`` prefix from the
     front of the suggested name, as many plugins (e.g. bzr-svn)
     want to be installed without this prefix. It is a common mistake
     to have a folder named "bzr-svn" for that plugin, especially
     as this is what bzr branch lp:bzr-svn will give you. (James Westby,
     Andrew Cowie)

   * UniqueIntegerBugTracker now appends bug-ids instead of joining
     them to the base URL. Plugins that register bug trackers may
     need a trailing / added to the base URL if one is not already there.
     (James Wesby, Andrew Cowie)

  FEATURES:

    * Added mail-mode GNU Emacs mail package as a mail_client.
      (Xavier Maillard, Bojan Nikolic)

    * Added start_commit hook for mutable trees. (Jelmer Vernooij, #186422)

    * ``status`` now accepts ``--no-pending`` to show the status without
      listing pending merges, which speeds up the command a lot on large
      histories.  (James Westby, #202830)

    * New ``post_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called after the
      branch tip is moved but while the branch is still write-locked.
      See the User Reference for signature details.
      (Ian Clatworthy, James Henstridge)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * The smart protocol now has support for setting branches' revision info
      directly.  This should make operations like push slightly faster, and=
 is a
      step towards server-side hooks.  The new request method name is
      ``Branch.set_last_revision_info``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``bzr commit --fixes`` now recognises "gnome" as a tag by default.
      (James Westby, Andrew Cowie)

    * ``bzr switch`` will attempt to find branches to switch to relative to=
 the
      current branch. E.g. ``bzr switch branchname`` will look for
      ``current_branch/../branchname``. (Robert Collins, Jelmer Vernooij,
      Wouter van Heyst)

    * Diff is now more specific about execute-bit changes it describes
      (Chad Miller)

    * Fetching data over HTTP is a bit faster when urllib is used.  This is=
 done
      by forcing it to recv 64k at a time when reading lines in HTTP header=
s,
      rather than just 1 byte at a time.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Log --short and --line are much faster when -r is not specified.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Merge is faster.  We no longer check a file's existence unnecessarily
      when merging the execute bit.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr status`` on an explicit list of files no longer shows pending
      merges, making it much faster on large trees. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The launchpad directory service now warns the user if they have not s=
et
      their launchpad login and are trying to resolve a URL using it, just
      in case they want to do a write operation with it.  (James Westby)

    * The smart protocol client is slightly faster, because it now only que=
ries
      the server for the protocol version once per connection.  Also, the H=
TTP
      transport will now automatically probe for and use a smart server if
      one is present.  You can use the new ``nosmart+`` transport decorator
      to get the old behaviour.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * The ``version`` command takes a ``--short`` option to print just the
      version number, for easier use in scripts.  (Martin Pool)

    * Various operations with revision specs and commands that calculate
      revnos and revision ids are faster.  (John A. Meinel, Aaron Bentley)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Add ``root_client_path`` parameter to SmartWSGIApp and
      SmartServerRequest.  This makes it possible to publish filesystem
      locations that don't exactly match URL paths. SmartServerRequest
      subclasses should use the new ``translate_client_path`` and
      ``transport_from_client_path`` methods when dealing with paths receiv=
ed
      from a client to take this into account.  (Andrew Bennetts, #124089)

    * ``bzr mv a b`` can be now used also to rename previously renamed
      directories, not only files. (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD, #107967)

    * ``bzr uncommit --local`` can now remove revisions from the local
      branch to be symmetric with ``bzr commit --local``.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #93412)

    * Don't ask for a password if there is no real terminal.
      (Alexander Belchenko, #69851)

    * Fix a bug causing a ValueError crash in ``parse_line_delta_iter`` when
      fetching revisions from a knit to pack repository or vice versa using
      bzr:// (including over http or ssh).
      (#208418, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool, Robert Collins)

    * Fixed ``_get_line`` in ``bzrlib.smart.medium``, which was buggy.  Also
      fixed ``_get_bytes`` in the same module to use the push back buffer.
      These bugs had no known impact in normal use, but were problematic for
      developers working on the code, and were likely to cause real bugs so=
oner
      or later.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Implement handling of basename parameter for DefaultMail.  (James Wes=
tby)

    * Incompatibility with Paramiko versions newer than 1.7.2 was fixed.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #213425)

    * Launchpad locations (lp: URLs) can be pulled.  (Aaron Bentley, #18194=
5)

    * Merges that add files to deleted root directories complete.  They
      do create conflicts.  (Aaron Bentley, #210092)

    * vsftp's return ``550 RNFR command failed.`` supported.
      (Marcus Trautwig, #129786)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved documentation on send/merge relationship. (Peter Schuller)

    * Minor fixes to the User Guide. (Matthew Fuller)

    * Reduced the evangelism in the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Added Integrating with Bazaar document for developers (Martin Albiset=
ti)

  API BREAKS:

    * Attempting to pull data from a ghost aware repository (e.g. knits) in=
to a
      non-ghost aware repository such as weaves will now fail if there are
      ghosts.  (Robert Collins)

    * ``KnitVersionedFile`` no longer accepts an ``access_mode`` parameter,=
 and
      now requires the ``index`` and ``access_method`` parameters to be
      supplied. A compatible shim has been kept in the new function
      ``knit.make_file_knit``. (Robert Collins)

    * Log formatters must now provide log_revision instead of show and
      show_merge_revno methods. The latter had been deprecated since the 0.=
17
      release. (James Westby)

    * ``LoopbackSFTP`` is now called ``SocketAsChannelAdapter``.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``osutils.backup_file`` is removed. (Alexander Belchenko)

    * ``Repository.get_revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement
      method. The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Colli=
ns)

    * ``revision.revision_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement functi=
on.
      The function was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

    * ``Transport.get_shared_medium`` is deprecated.  Use
      ``Transport.get_smart_medium`` instead.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``VersionedFile`` factories now accept a get_scope parameter rather
      than using a call to ``transaction_finished``, allowing the removal of
      the fixed list of versioned files per repository. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.annotate_iter`` is deprecated. While in principle this
      allowed lower memory use, all users of annotations wanted full file=
=20
      annotations, and there is no storage format suitable for incremental
      line-by-line annotation. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.clone_text`` is deprecated. This performance optimisa=
tion
      is no longer used - reading the content of a file that is undergoing a
      file level merge to identical state on two branches is rare enough, a=
nd
      not expensive enough to special case. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.clear_cache`` and ``enable_cache`` are deprecated.
      These methods added significant complexity to the ``VersionedFile``
      implementation, but were only used for optimising fetches from knits =
-=20
      which can be done from outside the knit layer, or via a caching
      decorator. As knits are not the default format, the complexity is no
      longer worth paying. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.create_empty`` is removed. This method presupposed a
      sensible mapping to a transport for individual files, but pack backed
      versioned files have no such mapping. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.get_graph`` is deprecated, with no replacement method.
      The method was size(history) and not desirable. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.get_graph_with_ghosts`` is deprecated, with no
      replacement method.  The method was size(history) and not desirable.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.get_parents`` is deprecated, please use
      ``VersionedFile.get_parent_map``. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.get_sha1`` is deprecated, please use
      ``VersionedFile.get_sha1s``. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.has_ghost`` is now deprecated, as it is both expensive
      and unused outside of a single test. (Robert Collins)

    * ``VersionedFile.iter_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``get_parent_map`` which can be used to instantiate a Graph on a
      VersionedFile. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * New -Dselftest_debug flag disables clearing of the debug flags during
      tests.  This is useful if you want to use e.g. -Dhpss to help debug a
      failing test.  Be aware that using this feature is likely to cause
      spurious test failures if used with the full suite. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * selftest --load-list now uses a new more agressive test loader that w=
ill
      avoid loading unneeded modules and building their tests. Plugins can =
use
      this new loader by defining a load_tests function instead of a test_s=
uite
      function. (a forthcoming patch will provide many examples on how to
      implement this).
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * selftest --load-list now does some sanity checks regarding duplicate =
test
      IDs and tests present in the list but not found in the actual test su=
ite.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Slightly more concise format for the selftest progress bar, so there's
      more space to show the test name.  (Martin Pool) ::

        [2500/10884, 1fail, 3miss in 1m29s] test_revisionnamespaces.TestRev

    * The test suite takes much less memory to run, and is a bit faster.  T=
his
      is done by clearing most attributes of TestCases after running them, =
if
      they succeeded.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added ``_build_client_protocol`` to ``_SmartClient``.  (Andrew Bennet=
ts)

    * Added basic infrastructure for automatic plugin suggestion.
      (Martin Albisetti)

    * If a ``LockableFiles`` object is not explicitly unlocked (for example
      because of a missing ``try/finally`` block, it will give a warning but
      not automatically unlock itself.  (Previously they did.)  This
      sometimes caused knock-on errors if for example the network connection
      had already failed, and should not be relied upon by code.=20
      (Martin Pool, #109520)

    * ``make dist`` target to build a release tarball, and also=20
      ``check-dist-tarball`` and ``dist-upload-escudero``.  (Martin Pool)

    * The ``read_response_tuple`` method of ``SmartClientRequestProtocol*``
      classes will now raise ``UnknownSmartMethod`` when appropriate, so th=
at
      callers don't need to try distinguish unknown request errors from oth=
er
      errors.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``set_make_working_trees`` is now implemented provided on all reposit=
ory
      implementations (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``VersionedFile`` now has a new method ``get_parent_map`` which, like
      ``Graph.get_parent_map`` returns a dict of key:parents. (Robert Colli=
ns)

Get version info for a file from Bazaar VCS
===========================================

About
=====
bzr-file-info.py is a simple script that helps to obtain info
about last changes in a file.

Usage:

     python bzr-file-info.py FILENAME

The script will produce output like this:

     #NN YYYY/MM/DD {rev-id}

Where:

     * NN - revision number of last modification of file;
     * YYYY/MM/DD - timestamp of last modification of file;
     * rev-id - revision id of last modification of file;

If file info is not available then script will emit '-'.

Using with Doxygen
==================
This script was designed to use it with doxygen.
You should specify name of the script as FILE_VERSION_FILTER parameter
in your Doxyfile, e.g.

    FILE_VERSION_FILTER = bzr-file-info.py

With this parameter doxygen will try to obtain version info for each
processed file.

Notes for Windows users
-----------------------
1) To enable execution of python scripts you need to have Python interpreter
    installed and you should ensure that your environment variable PATHEXT
    listed .PY extension in it.

2) If you're using standalone bzr.exe you should use Python 2.5 as default
    interpreter on your system, or you should install appropriate version
    of bzr suitable for your default Python interpreter.

3) You need to place bzr-file-info.py either to your working tree or
    any suitable directory listed in your PATH environment variable.

Notes for Unix/Linux users
--------------------------
If you put the script to your working tree you'll need to change Doxyfile
settings as:

    FILE_VERSION_FILTER = ./bzr-file-info.py

But this settings will not work on Windows.

Cached version
==============
bzr-file-info-w-cache.py is another version that used special cache file
to speed up subsequent info calculation for big trees with long history.
This script will store calculated info to file .bzr-file-info.cache
in current directory.

I'm happy to announce that bzr-svn 0.4.10 has been released. This is a
minor release, which mainly changes some bzr-svn internals and fixes=20
compatibility with Bazaar 1.4 and 1.5.

Changes in this release:

  CHANGES

   * Changed license from GPLv2 or later to GPLv3 or later.

  FEATURES

   * Add new ``log-strip-trailing-newline'' option which removes=20
     the last trailing newline from the log message when pushing=20
     to Subversion. This feature is only available for the=20
     experimental mappings. (#189227)

   * Allow more granularity over what properties are overridden using=20
     ``override-svn-revprops''. (#159143)

   * Add new ``append-revisions-only'' option with similar behaviour=20
     as in standard bzr formats. (#206242)

   * Parse mergeWithUpstream set by svn-buildpackage.

   * Cache last revision number during read locks, significantly speeds
     up push.

   * Use different cache for experimental versions of bzr-svn.

   * Support set_user_option() on Subversion branch BranchConfig. (#195962)

   * Support credentials in URLs. (#181534)

   * Allow usage without on-disk cache. This option is still=20
     experimental. (#131008)

  PERFORMANCE

   * No longer calculate inventory sha1's for svn revisions. Should provide=
=20
     some minor speed improvements.

   * Don't check full branch history when looking up the revno of a revisio=
n=20
     id.

   * Restrict history sample size used for guessing branching scheme to avo=
id
     looking at the full history for very large repositories.

   * New option ``reuse-revisions'' that determines how hard bzr-svn will=20
     try to reuse revisions when pushing into Subversion.

  INTERNALS

   * Branching from a Subversion repository will now fetch right-hand side=20
     parents as well as left hand side (mainline) parents, if specified.

   * Removed revision number cache.

   * Switch to using "repository layouts" rather than branching schemes.=20
     Layouts are not part of the mapping so don't affect the revision ident=
ity.

  BUGS

   * Avoid sometimes incorrect determination of Bazaar revision numbers. (#=
181773)

   * Deal with bzr:svn-revision-info property being removed. (#206728)

   * Gracefully handle erroneous svk merge tickets created by old versions =
of svk.

   * Use standard infrastructure for caching revision numbers. (#213953)

   * Work around bug in the Subversion libraries which don't accept=20
     http(s) URLs with urlencoded characters. (#190229)

   * Make sure committer name is UTF-8 encoded when overriding=20
     revision properties.

   * Fix installation of mapping3 package, don't rely on specific=20
     version of Python. (#227891)

 The tarball is available from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.10.tar.gz

GPG signature from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.10.tar.gz.asc

The release has been signed with my personal GPG key (1EEF5276) with
which I have also signed this e-mail.

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.5.0
This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.5.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- Added "heads" command, by Alexander Belchenko, to give it wider
  distribution.  Updated to avoid deprecated APIs
- Marked "show-paths" command obsolete.  This functionality is now
  provided by "bzr info".  show-paths will be removed in a future
  release.
- Added cdiff style-checking enhancements by Marius Kruger
- Update to bzr 1.5 API

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.5.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.5.0/+download/bzrtools-1.5.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.5.0/+download/bzrtools-1.5.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Bazaar 1.5 release candidate 1 is now available for your testing. Thanks
to everyone who participated, whether via patches, bug reports,
suggestions and feedback.

This is primarily a bugfix release, with a few performance improvements
thrown in.

John


bzr 1.5rc1 2008-05-09
- ---------------------

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

  CHANGES:

    * Broader support of GNU Emacs mail clients. Set
      ``mail_client=emacsclient`` in your bazaar.conf and ``send`` will
      pop the bundle in a mail buffer according to the value of
      ``mail-user-agent`` variable. (Xavier Maillard)

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Diff now handles revision specs like "branch:" and "submit:" more
      efficiently.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * More friendly error given when attempt to start the smart server
      on an address already in use. (Andrea Corbellini, #200575)

    * Pull completes much faster when there is nothing to pull.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Authentication.conf can define sections without password.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #199440)

    * Avoid muttering every time a child update does not cause a
      progress bar update. (John Arbash Meinel, #213771)

    * ``Branch.reconcile()`` is now implemented. This allows ``bzr
      reconcile`` to fix when a Branch has a non-canonical mainline
      history. ``bzr check`` also detects this condition.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #177855)

    * ``bzr commit`` now works with Microsoft's FTP service.
      (Andreas Deininger)

    * Catch definitions outside sections in authentication.conf.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #217650)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) updates
      inventory sha1s, even when bundles are used.
      (Aaron Bentley, #181391)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works correctly
      even though search keys are not topologically sorted.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works even when
      a parent revision has a different root id.
      (Aaron Bentley, #177874)

    * Disable strace testing until strace is fixed (see bug #103133) and
      emit a warning when selftest ends to remind us of leaking tests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #226769)

    * Fetching all revisions from a repository does not cause pack
      collisions.  (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley, #212908)

    * Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
      (Andrew Bennetts, #217701)

    * Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would
      break if the remote server was < version 1.2. This was due to a
      bug in the RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #214894)

    * Remove leftover code in ``bzr_branch`` that inappropriately
      creates a ``branch-name`` file in the branch control directory.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Set SO_REUSEADDR on server sockets of ``bzr serve`` to avoid
      problems rebinding the socket when starting the server a second
      time.  (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, #164288)

    * Severe performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories
      to knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on
      every graph walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph
      API.  There was another regression in knit => knit fetching which
      re-read the index for every revision each side had in common.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

    * When logging the changes to a particular file, there was a bug if
      there were ghosts in the revision ancestry.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Expanded the User Guide to include new chapters on popular plugins
      and integrating Bazaar into your environment. The *Best practices*
      chapter was renamed to *Miscellaneous topics* as suggested by
      community feedback as well. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Document outlining strategies for TortoiseBzr. (Mark Hammond)

    * Improved the documentation on hooks. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Update authentication docs regarding ssh agents.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #183705)

  TESTING:

    * Add ``thread_name_suffix`` parameter to
      SmartTCPServer_for_testing, to make it easy to identify which test
      spawned a thread with an unhandled exception. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * New ``--debugflag``/``-E`` option to ``bzr selftest`` for setting
      options for debugging tests, these are complementary to the the -D
      options.  The ``-Dselftest_debug`` global option has been replaced
      by the ``-E=allow_debug`` option for selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Parameterised test ids are preserved correctly to aid diagnosis of
      test failures. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The test suite modules have been modified to define load_tests()
      instead of test_suite(). That speeds up selective loading (via
      --load-list) significantly and provides many examples on how to
      migrate (grep for load_tests).  (Vincent Ladeuil)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``Hooks.install_hook`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``Hooks.install_named_hook`` which adds a required ``name``
      parameter, to avoid having to call ``Hooks.name_hook``.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * Implement xml8 serializer.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New form ``@deprecated_method(deprecated_in(1, 5, 0))`` for making
      deprecation wrappers.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``Repository.revision_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``Repository.get_parent_map([revid])[revid]``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * The Python ``assert`` statement is no longer used in Bazaar
      source, and a test checks this.  (Martin Pool)

  API BREAKS:

    * ``bzrlib.status.show_pending_merges`` requires the repository to
      be locked by the caller. Callers should have been doing it anyway,
      but it will now raise an exception if they do not.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Repository.get_data_stream,
      Repository.get_data_stream_for_search(),
      Repository.get_deltas_for_revsions(), Repository.revision_trees(),
      Repository.item_keys_introduced_by() no longer take read locks.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``LockableFiles.get_utf8`` is deprecated, as a start towards
      removing LockableFiles and ``.control_files`` entirely.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Methods deprecated prior to 1.1 have been removed.
      (Martin Pool)

Hash: SHA1

Thanks to all the hard working developers of the Bazaar version control
system, I'm pleased to announce our release 1.5, available now from
  http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download/

Tarballs are available now, and I expect Windows and Mac installers to be
available shortly.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed code, bug reports, suggestions and
general feedback. Keep it coming, and you'll get to see 1.6 in another month.

John

Release Notes:

bzr 1.5 2008-05-16
- ------------------

This release of Bazaar includes several updates to the documentation, and fixes
to prepare for making rich root support the default format. Many bugs have been
squashed, including fixes to log, bzr+ssh inter-operation with older servers.

  CHANGES:

    * Suppress deprecation warnings when bzrlib is a 'final' release. This way
      users of packaged software won't be bothered with DeprecationWarnings,
      but developers and testers will still see them. (John Arbash Meinel)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
      on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
      (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 1.5rc1 2008-05-09
- ---------------------

  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

  CHANGES:

    * Broader support of GNU Emacs mail clients. Set
      ``mail_client=emacsclient`` in your bazaar.conf and ``send`` will pop
      the bundle in a mail buffer according to the value of
      ``mail-user-agent`` variable. (Xavier Maillard)

  FEATURES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Diff now handles revision specs like "branch:" and "submit:" more
      efficiently.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * More friendly error given when attempt to start the smart server
      on an address already in use. (Andrea Corbellini, #200575)

    * Pull completes much faster when there is nothing to pull.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Authentication.conf can define sections without password.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #199440)

    * Avoid muttering every time a child update does not cause a progress bar
      update. (John Arbash Meinel, #213771)

    * ``Branch.reconcile()`` is now implemented. This allows ``bzr reconcile``
      to fix when a Branch has a non-canonical mainline history. ``bzr check``
      also detects this condition. (John Arbash Meinel, #177855)

    * ``bzr commit`` now works with Microsoft's FTP service.
      (Andreas Deininger)

    * Catch definitions outside sections in authentication.conf.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #217650)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) updates inventory
      sha1s, even when bundles are used.  (Aaron Bentley, #181391)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works correctly even
      though search keys are not topologically sorted.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Conversion from non-rich-root to rich-root(-pack) works even when a
      parent revision has a different root id.  (Aaron Bentley, #177874)

    * Disable strace testing until strace is fixed (see bug #103133) and emit
      a warning when selftest ends to remind us of leaking tests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #226769)

    * Fetching all revisions from a repository does not cause pack collisions.
      (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley, #212908)

    * Fix error about "attempt to add line-delta in non-delta knit".
      (Andrew Bennetts, #217701)

    * Pushing a branch in "dirstate" format (Branch5) over bzr+ssh would break
      if the remote server was < version 1.2. This was due to a bug in the
      RemoteRepository.get_parent_map() fallback code.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #214894)

    * Remove leftover code in ``bzr_branch`` that inappropriately creates
      a ``branch-name`` file in the branch control directory.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Set SO_REUSEADDR on server sockets of ``bzr serve`` to avoid problems
      rebinding the socket when starting the server a second time.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, #164288)

    * Severe performance degradation in fetching from knit repositories to
      knits and packs due to parsing the entire revisions.kndx on every graph
      walk iteration fixed by using the Repository.get_graph API.  There was
      another regression in knit => knit fetching which re-read the index for
      every revision each side had in common.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

    * When logging the changes to a particular file, there was a bug if there
      were ghosts in the revision ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #209948)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Expanded the User Guide to include new chapters on popular plugins and
      integrating Bazaar into your environment. The *Best practices* chapter
      was renamed to *Miscellaneous topics* as suggested by community
      feedback as well. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Document outlining strategies for TortoiseBzr. (Mark Hammond)

    * Improved the documentation on hooks. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Update authentication docs regarding ssh agents.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #183705)

  TESTING:

    * Add ``thread_name_suffix`` parameter to SmartTCPServer_for_testing, to
      make it easy to identify which test spawned a thread with an unhandled
      exception. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * New ``--debugflag``/``-E`` option to ``bzr selftest`` for setting
      options for debugging tests, these are complementary to the the -D
      options.  The ``-Dselftest_debug`` global option has been replaced by
      the ``-E=allow_debug`` option for selftest. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Parameterised test ids are preserved correctly to aid diagnosis of test
      failures. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

    * The test suite modules have been modified to define load_tests() instead
      of test_suite(). That speeds up selective loading (via --load-list)
      significantly and provides many examples on how to migrate (grep for
      load_tests).  (Vincent Ladeuil)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``Hooks.install_hook`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``Hooks.install_named_hook`` which adds a required ``name`` parameter,
      to avoid having to call ``Hooks.name_hook``. (Daniel Watkins)

    * Implement xml8 serializer.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * New form ``@deprecated_method(deprecated_in(1, 5, 0))`` for making
      deprecation wrappers.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``Repository.revision_parents`` is now deprecated in favour of
      ``Repository.get_parent_map([revid])[revid]``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * The Python ``assert`` statement is no longer used in Bazaar source, and
      a test checks this.  (Martin Pool)

  API BREAKS:

    * ``bzrlib.status.show_pending_merges`` requires the repository to be
      locked by the caller. Callers should have been doing it anyway, but it
      will now raise an exception if they do not. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Repository.get_data_stream, Repository.get_data_stream_for_search(),
      Repository.get_deltas_for_revsions(), Repository.revision_trees(),
      Repository.item_keys_introduced_by() no longer take read locks.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``LockableFiles.get_utf8`` is deprecated, as a start towards
      removing LockableFiles and ``.control_files`` entirely.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Methods deprecated prior to 1.1 have been removed.

I've just released beta 1 of Bazaar 1.6.  We'd particularly appreciate
testing and feedback on bzr+ssh networking in this release.

We still expect to land more changes in the remainder of this week
before 1.6 freeze, but wanted to get some initial wider testing of the
networking changes.

Thanks very much to every one who sent feedback, patches,
documentation or encouragement for this release, especially the
first-time patch contributors.

Source is available now from <https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6>


bzr 1.6beta1 2008-06-02
-----------------------

Commands that work on the revision history such as push, pull, missing,
uncommit and missing are now substantially faster.  This release adds a
translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish.  (Contributions of
other translations would be very welcome.)  Bazaar 1.6beta1 adds a new network
protocol which is used by default and which allows for more efficient transfers
and future extensions.


  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr://, bzr+ssh://
      and bzr+http:// connections.  This will allow more efficient requests and
      responses, and more graceful fallback when a server is too old to
      recognise a request from a more recent client.  Bazaar 1.6 will
      interoperate with 0.16 and later versions, but servers should be upgraded
      when possible.  Bazaar 1.6 no longer interoperates with 0.15 and
earlier via
      these protocols.  Use alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #83935)

  CHANGES:

    * Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr selftest``
      so that developers can see if their code is using deprecated functions.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  FEATURES:

    * Adding ``-Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin fails to
      load. (James Westby)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr branch/push/pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for finding
      the revno of the new revision (``Graph.find_distance_to_null``). This
      should make something like ``bzr branch -r -100`` in a shared, no-trees
      repository much snappier. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr log --short -r X..Y`` no longer needs to access the full revision
      history. This makes it noticeably faster when logging the last few
      revisions. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr ls`` now accepts ``-V`` as an alias for ``--versioned``.
      (Jerad Cramp, #165086)

    * ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and
      ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without having
      to search the whole ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #174625)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access, rather than always
      extracting the full revision history for a branch. This makes it
      resolve the appropriate revisions much faster (in testing it drops
      uncommit from 1.5s => 0.4s). It also means ``bzr log --short`` is one
      step closer to not using full revision history.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #172649)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr merge --lca`` should handle when two revisions have no common
      ancestor other than NULL_REVISION. (John Arbash Meinel, #235715)

    * ``bzr push`` with both ``--overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no longer
      fails.  (Andrew Bennetts, #234229)

    * Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using bzr+http://
      URLs, which was causing spurious "No repository present" errors with
      branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #230550)

    * Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so that all
      implementations have the attribute.  Fixes 'PyCurlTransport' object has no
      attribute '_remote_is_at_least_1_2' attribute errors.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #220806)

    * Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning
      message, not a fatal error.  It may for example fail if the file is still
      in use by another process.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the amount of
      data we try to read per ``recv`` call.  The problem was observed with
      Windows and a proxy, but might affect other environments as well.
      (Eric Holmberg, #215426)

    * Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger.from_mergeable.  Stricter
      get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in authentication.conf when
      used for an ssh scheme (sftp or bzr+ssh).
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #203186)

    * Make both http implementations raise appropriate exceptions on 403
      Forbidden when POSTing smart requests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #230223)

    * Properly *title* header names in http requests instead of capitalizing
      them.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #229076)

    * Treat an encoding of '' as ascii; this can happen when bzr is run
      under vim on Mac OS X.
      (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added directory structure and started translation of docs in spanish.
      (Martin Albisetti, Lucio Albenga)

    * Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
      on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * More Bazaar developer documentation about packaging and release process,
      and about use of Python reprs.
      (Martin Pool, Martin Albisetti)

    * Updated Tortise strategy document. (Mark Hammond)

  TESTING:

    * New helper function for splitting test suites
      ``split_suite_by_condition``. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

  API CHANGES:

    * ``Branch.abspath`` is deprecated; use the Tree or Transport
      instead.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``Branch.update_revisions`` now takes an optional ``Graph``
      object. This can be used by ``update_revisions`` when it is
      checking ancestry, and allows callers to prefer request to go to a
      local branch.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch, Repository, Tree and BzrDir should expose a Transport as an
      attribute if they have one, rather than having it indirectly accessible
      as ``.control_files._transport``.  This doesn't add a requirement
      to support a Transport in cases where it was not needed before;
      it just simplifies the way it is reached.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr missing --mine-only`` will return status code 0 if you have no
      new revisions, but the remote does. Similarly for ``--theirs-only``.
      The new code only checks one side, so it doesn't know if the other
      side has changes. This seems more accurate with the request anyway.
      It also changes the output to print '[This|Other] branch is up to
      date.' rather than displaying nothing.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``LockableFiles.put_utf8``, ``put_bytes`` and ``controlfilename``
      are now deprecated in favor of using Transport operations.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Many methods on ``VersionedFile``, ``Repository`` and in
      ``bzrlib.revision``  deprecated before bzrlib 1.5 have been removed.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` can be set to False for a given
      ``RevisionSpec``. This will disable the existing behavior of passing in
      the full revision history to ``self._match_on``. Useful for specs that
      don't actually need access to the full history. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The constructors of ``SmartClientMedium`` and its subclasses now require a
      ``base`` parameter.  ``SmartClientMedium`` implementations now also need
      to provide a ``remote_path_from_transport`` method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * The default permissions for creating new files and directories
      should now be obtained from ``BzrDir._get_file_mode()`` and
      ``_get_dir_mode()``, rather than from LockableFiles.  The
``_set_file_mode``
      and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles which were advertised
      as a way for plugins to control this are no longer consulted.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated. This method required local

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.6.0.

It comes a little early because the beta versions of Bazaar 1.6 are
already out, and we don't usually have these.

However, bzrtools remains committed to our legacy of never having beta
versions or release candidates, so 1.6.0 it is.

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.6.x Bazaar
series, though with major features still not landed, it's possible I'll
have to do a point release.

BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- - show-paths command removed (bzr info provides this now)
- - baz-import and baz-import-branch removed (split into a separate
project).
- - Bug when TERM environment variable is unset now handled.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.6.0 is available at:

http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.6.0/+download/bzrtools-1.6.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.6.0/+download/bzrtools-1.6.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

The Bazaar team has just released bazaar 1.6beta2, which is preparing
for a new release adding a faster bzr+ssh network protocol, and a
branch-stacking feature.  We'd appreciate your help in testing it with
your own branches.

The source for this release is now available from
<https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6beta2>, and packages for various
systems should be available shortly from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download>.  For Ubuntu users, 1.6beta2 will
soon be in a Launchpad apt archive, described at
<https://launchpad.net/~bzr-beta-ppa/+archive>

Thanks to everyone who sent patches, bug reports, feedback and questions.

Martin

bzr 1.6beta2 2008-06-10
-----------------------

This release contains further progress towards our 1.6 goals of shallow
repositories, and contains a fix for some user-affecting bugs in the
repository layer.  Building working trees during checkout and branch is
now faster.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid KnitCorrupt error extracting inventories from some repositories=
.
      (The data is not corrupt; an internal check is detecting a problem
      reading from the repository.)
      (Martin Pool, Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, #234748)

    * Inserting a bundle which changes the contents of a file with no trail=
ing
      end of line, causing a knit snapshot in a 'knits' repository
will no longer
      cause KnitCorrupt. (Robert Collins)

    * ``RemoteBranch.pull`` needs to return the ``self._real_branch``'s
      pull result. It was instead just returning None, which breaks ``bzr
      pull``. (John Arbash Meinel, #238149)

    * Sanitize branch nick before using it as an attachment filename in
      ``bzr send``. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #210218)

    * Squash ``inv_entry.symlink_target`` to a plain string when
      generating DirState details. This prevents from getting a
      ``UnicodeError`` when you have symlinks and non-ascii filenames.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #135320)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added the 'alias' command to set/unset and display aliases. (Tim Penh=
ey)

    * ``added``, ``modified``, and ``unknowns`` behaviour made
consistent (all three
      now quote paths where required). Added ``--null`` option to ``added``=
 and
      ``modified`` (for null-separated unknowns, use ``ls --unknown --null`=
`)
      (Adrian Wilkins)

    * Faster branching (1.09x) and lightweight checkouts (1.06x) on large t=
rees.
      (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added *Bazaar Zen* section to the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

  TESTING:

    * Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it=
 is
      running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
      which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the sam=
e
      tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
      record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
      ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

  INTERNALS:

    * Knit record serialisation is now stricter on what it will accept, to
      guard against potential internal bugs, or broken input. (Robert Colli=
ns)


bzr 1.6beta1 2008-06-02
-----------------------


Commands that work on the revision history such as push, pull, missing,
uncommit and log are now substantially faster.  This release adds a
translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish.  (Contributions=
 of
other translations would be very welcome.)  Bazaar 1.6beta1 adds a new netw=
ork
protocol which is used by default and which allows for more efficient trans=
fers
and future extensions.


  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr://, bzr+s=
sh://
      and bzr+http:// connections.  This will allow more efficient requests=
 and
      responses, and more graceful fallback when a server is too old to
      recognise a request from a more recent client.  Bazaar 1.6 will
      interoperate with 0.16 and later versions, but servers should be upgr=
aded
      when possible.  Bazaar 1.6 no longer interoperates with 0.15 and
earlier via
      these protocols.  Use alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers=
.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #83935)

  CHANGES:

    * Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr selfte=
st``
      so that developers can see if their code is using deprecated function=
s.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  FEATURES:

    * Adding ``-Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin fails t=
o
      load. (James Westby)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr branch/push/pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for findin=
g
      the revno of the new revision (``Graph.find_distance_to_null``). This
      should make something like ``bzr branch -r -100`` in a shared, no-tre=
es
      repository much snappier. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr log --short -r X..Y`` no longer needs to access the full revisi=
on
      history. This makes it noticeably faster when logging the last few
      revisions. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr ls`` now accepts ``-V`` as an alias for ``--versioned``.
      (Jerad Cramp, #165086)

    * ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and
      ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without hav=
ing
      to search the whole ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #174625)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access, rather than always
      extracting the full revision history for a branch. This makes it
      resolve the appropriate revisions much faster (in testing it drops
      uncommit from 1.5s =3D> 0.4s). It also means ``bzr log --short`` is o=
ne
      step closer to not using full revision history.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #172649)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr merge --lca`` should handle when two revisions have no common
      ancestor other than NULL_REVISION. (John Arbash Meinel, #235715)

    * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * ``bzr push`` with both ``--overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no long=
er
      fails.  (Andrew Bennetts, #234229)

    * Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using bzr+http://
      URLs, which was causing spurious "No repository present" errors with
      branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #230550)

    * Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so that a=
ll
      implementations have the attribute.  Fixes 'PyCurlTransport' object h=
as no
      attribute '_remote_is_at_least_1_2' attribute errors.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #220806)

    * Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning
      message, not a fatal error.  It may for example fail if the file is s=
till
      in use by another process.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the amount=
 of
      data we try to read per ``recv`` call.  The problem was observed with
      Windows and a proxy, but might affect other environments as well.
      (Eric Holmberg, #215426)

    * Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger.from_mergeable.  Stri=
cter
      get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here.  (Aaron Bentle=
y)

    * Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in authentication.conf =
when
      used for an ssh scheme (sftp or bzr+ssh).
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #203186)

    * Make both http implementations raise appropriate exceptions on 403
      Forbidden when POSTing smart requests.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #230223)

    * Properly *title* header names in http requests instead of capitalizin=
g
      them.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #229076)

    * The "Unable to obtain lock" error message now also suggests using
      ``bzr break-lock`` to fix it.  (Martin Albisetti, #139202)

    * Treat an encoding of '' as ascii; this can happen when bzr is run
      under vim on Mac OS X.
      (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

    * ``VersionedFile.make_mpdiffs()`` was raising an exception that wasn't=
 in
      scope. (Daniel Fischer #235687)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added directory structure and started translation of docs in spanish.
      (Martin Albisetti, Lucio Albenga)

    * Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil Martinsen-Burrell
      on the plugin and integration chapters of the User Guide.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * More Bazaar developer documentation about packaging and release proce=
ss,
      and about use of Python reprs.
      (Martin Pool, Martin Albisetti)

    * Updated Tortise strategy document. (Mark Hammond)

  TESTING:

    * ``bzrlib.tests.adapt_tests`` was broken and unused - it has been fixe=
d.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while it=
 is
      running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert Collins)

    * New helper function for splitting test suites
      ``split_suite_by_condition``. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``Branch.missing_revisions`` has been deprecated. Similar functionali=
ty
      can be obtained using ``bzrlib.missing.find_unmerged``. The api was
      fairly broken, and the function was unused, so we are getting rid of =
it.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``Branch.abspath`` is deprecated; use the Tree or Transport
      instead.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``Branch.update_revisions`` now takes an optional ``Graph``
      object. This can be used by ``update_revisions`` when it is
      checking ancestry, and allows callers to prefer request to go to a
      local branch.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch, Repository, Tree and BzrDir should expose a Transport as an
      attribute if they have one, rather than having it indirectly accessib=
le
      as ``.control_files._transport``.  This doesn't add a requirement
      to support a Transport in cases where it was not needed before;
      it just simplifies the way it is reached.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr missing --mine-only`` will return status code 0 if you have no
      new revisions, but the remote does. Similarly for ``--theirs-only``.
      The new code only checks one side, so it doesn't know if the other
      side has changes. This seems more accurate with the request anyway.
      It also changes the output to print '[This|Other] branch is up to
      date.' rather than displaying nothing.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``LockableFiles.put_utf8``, ``put_bytes`` and ``controlfilename``
      are now deprecated in favor of using Transport operations.
      (Martin Pool)

    * Many methods on ``VersionedFile``, ``Repository`` and in
      ``bzrlib.revision``  deprecated before bzrlib 1.5 have been removed.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` can be set to False for a giv=
en
      ``RevisionSpec``. This will disable the existing behavior of passing =
in
      the full revision history to ``self._match_on``. Useful for specs tha=
t
      don't actually need access to the full history. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * The constructors of ``SmartClientMedium`` and its subclasses now requ=
ire a
      ``base`` parameter.  ``SmartClientMedium`` implementations now also n=
eed
      to provide a ``remote_path_from_transport`` method.  (Andrew Bennetts=
)

    * The default permissions for creating new files and directories
      should now be obtained from ``BzrDir._get_file_mode()`` and
      ``_get_dir_mode()``, rather than from LockableFiles.  The
``_set_file_mode``
      and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles which were advertise=
d
      as a way for plugins to control this are no longer consulted.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated. This method required local
      instances of both versioned file objects and was thus hostile to bein=
g
      used for streaming from a smart server. The new get_record_stream and
      insert_record_stream are meant to efficiently replace this method.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out revisions
      which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you merge the sam=
e
      tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing merge, it will only
      record the newest. (If you merge a descendent, it will replace its
      ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * ``WorkingTreeFormat2.stub_initialize_remote`` is now private.
      (Martin Pool)

Hi everybody!

I've just uploaded the 5th release of bzr-gedit!
The "only" new feature in this release is the "browse branch" sidebar!
You can view the entire changelog here:
https://launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/+announcement/513

And download, as usual, from here: https://launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/0.5/0.5


Thanks everyone for your help!

Hi!

I've just uploaded a new version of bzr-gedit, 0.56.
I think this one is the less stable since the first ones, mostly because th=
e
"threading" method used is kind of experimental because I had to get away
from Gedit thread lock.

Official announcemente here:
https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/+announcement/562
You can get your copy from launchpad:

This may interest many people in the Bazaar community:
http://ianclatworthy.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/announcing-the-community-agile-project/.

Steve Alexander gave a presentation on this at EuroPython
a few hours ago so it was time to release the paper!
I haven't had a chance to upload anything yet to the
project's web-site but a project team has been created
on Launchpad that interested people can join.

If you're interested in helping out, please help spread
the word by blogging about this. FWIW, the next goal is
to put together a website using ReST and Sphinx
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) that teams can download
and tweak. As well as containing the overview paper,
the website should contain links to related tools
and sections for dropping in coding standards, procedures,
etc.

Cheers,
Ian C.

Hi all,

I've implemented preliminary support for multiple projects in Bundle Buggy.

The front page will stay the same, for now, but I've also added BzrTools
and Bundle Buggy as projects:
http://bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com/project/bundlebuggy/request

Incoming merge requests are categorized into projects according to their
merge directive's target branch.  (I have pondered more clever
approaches, but have not implemented them yet.)

If you would like your project to use bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com,
please contact me.

Aaron

The voters for bzr-gtk are different from the voters for bzr though, is
that list separate as well? Also, is there some web UI for maintaining
the voters list of a project? 

If bzr-gtk's bundlebuggy could be hosted on aaronbentley.com, that would
fix some of the maintainance issues we have at the moment (host
disappearing suddenly, emails not being parsed, etc). 

Cheers,

Jelmer

Yes.  For each user, there is a list of the projects on which they can vote.

Not yet.

Okay, I've added bzr-gtk to bundlebuggy.aaronbentley.com
I'm happy to work out the maintenance issues with you.

This is a requirement for off-site hosting I think, since otherwise all
new voters or new voter email addresses or new voter passwords would
have to go through you.

Thanks!

The maintainance issues are all caused by the machine the current
bzr-gtk bundlebuggy is running on, not by the bundlebuggy itself in any
way.

Cheers,

I'm happy to announce the release of beta3 of bzr1.6.

This release adds a new 'stacked branches' feature allowing branches to
share storage without being in the same repository or on the same machine.
(See the user guide for more details.)  It also adds a new hook, improved
weaves, aliases for related locations, faster bzr+ssh push, and several
bug fixes.

We'd particularly appreciate testing and feedback on all changes in
this release.



-- 
Martin <http://launchpad.net/~mbp/>


bzr 1.6beta2 2008-07-17
-----------------------

  FEATURES:

    * New ``pre_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called before the
      branch tip is moved, while the branch is write-locked.  See the User
      Reference for signature details.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Rule-based preferences can now be defined for selected files in
      selected branches, allowing commands and plugins to provide
      custom behaviour for files matching defined patterns.
      See ``Rule-based preferences`` (part of ``Configuring Bazaar``)
      in the User Guide and ``bzr help rules`` for more information.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Sites may suggest a branch to stack new branches on.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Stacked branches are now supported. See ``bzr help branch`` and
      ``bzr help push``.  Branches must be in the ``development1`` format
      to stack, though the stacked-on branch can be of any format.
      (Robert Collins)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr export --format=tgz --root=NAME -`` to export a gzipped tarball
      to stdout; also ``tar`` and ``tbz2``.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr (re)merge --weave`` will now use a standard Weave algorithm,
      rather than the annotation-based merge it was using. It does so by
      building up a Weave of the important texts, without needing to build
      the full ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #238895)

    * ``bzr send`` documents and better supports ``emacsclient`` (proper
      escaping of mail headers and handling of the MUA Mew).
      (Christophe Troestler)

    * Remembered locations can be specified by aliases, e.g. :parent, :public,
      :submit.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * The smart protocol now has improved support for setting branches'
      revision info directly.  This makes operations like push
      faster.  The new request method name is
      ``Branch.set_last_revision_ex``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Bazaar is now able to be a client to the web server of IIS 6 and 7.
      The broken implementations of RFC822 in Python and RFC2046 in IIS
      combined with boundary-line checking in Bazaar previously made this
      impossible. (NB, IIS 5 does not suffer from this problem).
      (Adrian Wilkins, #247585)

    * ``bzr log --long`` with a ghost in your mainline now handles that
      ghost properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #243536)

    * ``check`` handles the split-up .bzr layout correctly, so no longer
      requires a branch to be present.
      (Daniel Watkins, #64783)

    * Clearer message about how to set the PYTHONPATH if bzrlib can't be
      loaded.
      (Martin Pool, #205230)

    * Errors about missing libraries are now shown without a traceback,
      and with a suggestion to install the library.  The full traceback is
      still in ``.bzr.log`` and can be shown with ``-Derror``.
      (Martin Pool, #240161)

    * Fetch from a stacked branch copies all required data.
      (Aaron Bentley, #248506)

    * Handle urls such as ftp://user@host.com@www.host.com where the user
      name contains an @.
      (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #228058)

    * ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now suppress an error during
      ``unlock`` if there was an error in the original function. This helps
      most when there is a failure with a smart server action, since often the
      connection closes and we cannot unlock.
      (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #125784)

    * Obsolete hidden command ``bzr fetch`` removed.
      (Martin Pool, #172870)

    * Raise the correct exception when doing ``-rbefore:0`` or ``-c0``.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #239933)

    * You can now compare file revisions in Windows diff programs from
      Cygwin Bazaar.
      (Matt McClure, #209281)

    * revision_history now tolerates mainline ghosts for Branch format 6.
      (Aaron Bentley, #235055)

    * Set locale from environment for third party libs.
      (Martin von Gagern, #128496)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added *Using stacked branches* to the User Guide.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Updated developer documentation.
      (Martin Pool)

  TESTING:

   * ``-Dmemory`` will cause /proc/PID/status to be catted before bzr
     exits, allowing low-key analysis of peak memory use. (Robert Collins)

   * ``TestCaseWithTransport.make_branch_and_tree`` tries harder to return
     a tree with a ``branch`` attribute of the right format.  This was
     preventing some ``RemoteBranch`` tests from actually running with
     ``RemoteBranch`` instances.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  API CHANGES:

    * Removed ``Repository.text_store``, ``control_store``, etc.  Instead,
      there are new attributes ``texts, inventories, revisions,
      signatures``, each of which is a ``VersionedFiles``.  See the
      Repository docstring for more details.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``Branch.pull`` now accepts an ``_override_hook_target`` optional
      parameter.  If you have a subclass of ``Branch`` that overrides
      ``pull`` then you should add this parameter.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``bzrlib.check.check()`` has been deprecated in favour of the more
      aptly-named ``bzrlib.check.check_branch()``.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * ``Tree.print_file`` and ``Repository.print_file`` are deprecated.
      These methods are bad APIs because they write directly to sys.stdout.
      bzrlib does not use them internally, and there are no direct tests
      for them. (Alexander Belchenko)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``cat`` command no longer uses ``Tree.print_file()`` internally.
      (Alexander Belchenko)

    * New class method ``BzrDir.open_containing_tree_branch_or_repository``
      which eases the discovery of the tree, the branch and the repository
      containing a given location.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * New ``versionedfile.KeyMapper`` interface to abstract out the access to
      underlying .knit/.kndx etc files in repositories with partitioned
      storage. (Robert Collins)

    * Obsolete developer-use command ``weave-join`` has been removed.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``RemoteToOtherFetcher`` and ``get_data_stream_for_search`` removed,
      to support new ``VersionedFiles`` layering.
      (Robert Collins)

On behalf of QBzr developers I'm pleased to announce
new shining release QBzr 0.9.2!

This release is first step towards QBzr 1.0.

In this release QBzr introduce new qlog view with nice graph of revisions.
qcat window now allow you to see images as images, binary files as hex dump,
and target for versioned symlink. Side-by-side diff now able to show changes
in image files; side-by-side and unidiff will show you changes in executable
bit as well. Also you can specify in command line which files
(added/removed/modified/renamed) you want to see in qdiff.

Also there is many other improvements and many bugfixes.
See the list of user-visible changes below.

I'd like to say big thanks to Gary van der Merwe who wrote this incredible
new qlog with graph (a-la viz), and made many other improvements too
(don't forget performance improvements!).
Without his participation this release would be just regular bugfix release.
Thank you Gary, and keep it up!

NOTES: when upgrading old installation of QBzr to 0.9.2, please uninstall
or remove old files first.

Hi everybody!

I've just uploaded the new bzr-gedit release, 0.65.

This release is all about adding options to commands, so now you can push a
specific revision,
commit only the files you want, un-commit only local changes in a bound
branch, etc, etc, etc!!!

Here you can view the official announcement with changelog:
https://launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/+announcement/755
And this is the download link: https://launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/0.6/0.65

Thanks to everyone in the community testing and reporting bugs.
If you still didn't tested this plugin, this is the best time. It's very
close to be finished and we need testers for all the new options!!1

Also, thanks Canonica for the support!!!

I'm happy to announce the first release candidate for version 0.4.11 of
bzr-svn. This is a major release, probably the largest of bzr-svn to
date. It addresses half of all the currently open bugs in bzr-svn
(including incomplete and wishlist bugs), makes it easier to install and
improves the number of bzr commands that can be run against Subversion
repositories.

This release was the first to receive a significant amount of
contributions from other people than myself. Thanks to everybody who
contributed! A full list of contributors can be found in AUTHORS and the
bzr-svn revision history.

bzr-svn now no longer requires a patched version of Subversion; it'll
just work with any copy of the Subversion library since 1.4.0.

The full list of changes since 0.4.10 is:

  CHANGES

   * bzr-svn now comes with its own Python bindings for the Subversion=20
     libraries, removing the need for a unreleased version of Subversion
and=20
     improving performance.

     It does however mean the extensions have to be built. This
requires=20
     the Subversion development libraries and should be possible by=20
     simply running ``make`` from the plugin directory.=20

	 This fixes some existing bzr-svn related bugs caused by
Python-Subversion:

     * KeyboardInterrupts are now no longer swallowed.  (#242217)

     * Crash bug trying to access sites that use self-signed
certificates.=20
       (#238529)

     * Username and password prompting will now always work.

   * The "svn+https://..." syntax has been deprecated. It still works in
the=20
     current release but will be removed in the future. If you are
unable to=20
	 get a repository to work without the svn+ prefix, please file a bug.

  FEATURES
 =20
   * Add new "dpush" command that works similar to git-svn's dcommit.

   * Support proper Bazaar tags. (#81102)

   * Set mergeinfo properties when pushing merges. (write part of
#131323)

   * Basic (experimental) support for stacked branches. Not very
     efficient at the moment because of certain assumptions in the=20
	 stacking implementation.

   * Avoid reopening connections to branch and repository when finding=20
     branches. (#243749)

   * Show Subversion revision numbers in log output. (#161830)

   * Extend "bzr help svn".

   * Warn when trying to clone a repository root as a branch. (#244638)

   * Much faster Repository.get_revision_delta(). (#127030)

   * Support bzr push --overwrite. (#118787)

   * Support bzr uncommit.

   * Support bzr sign-my-commits. (Requires revision properties in the=20
	 Subversion repository to be mutable)

   * Support pushing merged revisions. To enable, set=20
     ``push_merged_revisions =3D True'' in the repository config.
(#158883)

  BUG FIXES

   * Now uses absolute imports and no longer adds plugin directory to
the=20
     system path.

   * More efficient use of mutter.

   * Remember parent branch correctly during sprout. (#237174)

   * Raise appropriate errors when using annotate.

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.6.

   * Fix case insensitive handling of paths in=20
     CachingLogWalker.find_latest_change(). (#233964)

   * Fix compatibility with newer versions of Subversion. (#229419)

   * Deal with parent branch changing name in Repository.iter_changes().
     (#229410)

   * Fix ability to use bzr-svn with disabling cache.

   * Fix use of unicode characters in filenames in working trees.

   * Fix use of unicode characters in filenames when committing.
(#230090)

   * Fix modifying branching scheme from the command-line. (#230529)

   * Cope with kind changes better. (#191576)

   * Fix dealing with strange remove during replace operation. (#232196)

   * Deal with missing branches/tags directories when using webdav.
(#235301)

   * Remove endless loop in logwalker. (#235776)

   * Convert redirect requests received from Subversion. (#229848)

   * New function for finding path children that's faster and more
correct.=20
     (#240954)

   * Support cloning bzr-svn branches (will clone to rich-root-pack).
(#229819)

   * Fix inconsistent revision iteration when branches' parents were
moved but=20
     not changed. (#237901)

   * Avoid assumption that a revision can only occur in one branch.
(#208566)

   * Several fixes for dealing with non-acii characters. (#128496)

   * Re-use RA connections as much as possible. bzr-svn should in
general now=20
     have no more than 2 TCP/IP connections to the same Subversion
repository=20
     open at the same time. (#183824)

   * Cope with files that are special files but not symlinks. (#245788)

   * Deliver encoded paths in URLs to Subversion in switch() and
reparent()
     functions. (#248892)

   * Lazily connect to repository when opening working copies. (#250706)

   * Stricter checking of special files for links. (#219832)

   * Avoid showing backtrace for RA_DAV_REQUEST_FAILED errors, since=20
     they may be raised in other situations than when a bug is hit.
	 (#253376)

   * Fixed http exception during expensive log -v. (#94316)

   * Preserve individual text revision ids correctly when
round-tripping. (#250480)

The tarball can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.11~rc1.tar.gz

A GPG signature, made with my key, can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.11~rc1.tar.gz.asc

Please file bugs in Launchpad, so they can be fixed before the final
release:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+filebug

If there are particular bugs or regressions you think should be fixed
before the final release, please let me know.

I hope to release the final version of 0.4.11 somewhere around the 24th.

Cheers,

Jelmer

Hi!

I've just released bzr-gedit 0.70!

1 and 1/2 new feature.
A command line to execute bazaar commands not implemented in the plugin.
The 1/2 feature is the output window, which now shows ouput for very few 
commands. I'll be fixing that soon.

As usual, "official" announcement: 
https://launchpad.net/bzr-gedit/+announcement/864

Thanks everybody for the support!!

There were a couple small regressions found in the 1.6rc1 release. This
release is a minor change to the rc1 release, with those regressions fixed. We
would expect to release 1.6-final within the next week if no more regressions
our found.

There is lots of great new stuff in 1.6, and we would love to have people
testing this release candidate, to make sure it is as great of a release as we
can make it.

The source code and changelog is available from:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6rc2/

Packages for Ubuntu should be available soon in the PPA:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr-beta-ppa/+archive

And for other systems (Mac OSX, Win32) from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

Many thanks to all who have contributed to this release.

There were a few minor improvements still desired for the 1.6 release. In my
desire to get the release out the door, I didn't get a full response from all
time zones. This release should include everything that people wanted to
include in the 1.6 release of Bazaar, and I fully expect it to become
1.6-final with no further changes.

The source code is again available through launchpad at
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6rc3/

And I would expect the beta-ppa to be updated later today.

So, after a few interesting months of work, I'm absolutely thrilled to
be releasing Loggerhead 1.6.

It has gone through many drastic changes, and is now in very good shape.

The highlights are:

- Shiny new theme
- Switched from turbogears/KID to wsgi/paste/simpletal (we're now very
dependency-friendly)
- Setup now works and does the right thing (tm)
- New configuration-less startup script (serve-branches)
- Performance improvements
- Updated to work with bzr 1.6
- URLs are now human-friendly (they use revnos instead of revids)
- Integration with bzr-search

The full announcement is available here:
https://launchpad.net/loggerhead/+announcement/885

One of the things I'm most happy about this release, is the amount of
people who have contributed to it (aside from Michael Hudson, who is
the maintainer and core developer and myself), so I'd like to list
them in no particular order:

- Matt Nordhoff (Peng)
- Paul Hummer (rockstar)
- Jelmer Vernooij (jelmer)
- Robert Collins (lifeless)
- Matteo Settenvini
- Tim Penhey (thumper)
- John Arbash Meinel (jam)


Canonical has sponsored the bulk of the work, so a big thanks to them too  :)

You can download it from:
http://launchpad.net/loggerhead/1.6/1.6/+download/loggerhead-1.6.tar.gz
Hopefully, we'll have a .deb in PPA soon.

I'll send a draft for 1.7 (or 1.8, we're keeping in sync with bzr
releases) to the list so we can discuss what we want for the next
version.


Cheers, and a big thanks to everyone!

Martin

QBzr 0.9.3 is released. This is maintenance release, it provides a dozen bugfixes
and several new features, like ability to refresh diff window, new translations
(see changelog below).

0.9.3 is intended to be used with upcoming bzr/TortoiseBzr 1.6 and with older versions
of bzr too.

Changelog:

  * qcommit:
     * Double-click on pending merge show changes properly (#252879).
     * Better support for compiz (#245419).
     * New command-line options: --local and --message (#253613).
  * qdiff:
     * Added a refresh button (#252191).
     * Workaround for random segfault of qdiff due to the bug in bzrlib's
       C implementation of patience diff sequence matcher.
     * Show x-bit (+x) property for added/removed files in side-by-side view.
  * qlog:
     * When you search on revision id or revision number, it selects the
       revision that matches, rather than filtering the ones that don't.
       This is also faster.
     * New revision details view.
     * Fixed problem with showing merges for some branches (#255265).
     * Support for Redmine bug URLs.
  * merge --qpreview:
     * workaround for bug in bzrlib's PreviewTree related to renamed files
       (#251537).
  * qpull/qbranch:
     * Better detection of bzr executable for the case of standalone bzr.exe
       (#256793).
  * New translations: Dutch, French, Italian, Japanese

Launchpad Translations service re-enabled for translations of QBzr strings.

NOTES: when upgrading old installation (<0.9.2) of QBzr to 0.9.3,
please uninstall or remove old files first.

Two more issues were found sequentially, so we are now on the 5th candidate
for release as 1.6. One was a strict regression, the other was just a problem
with a new feature that I chose to disable.

The problem found in 1.6rc4 is significant enough that I'll be delaying
1.6-final until Monday, August 25th (one week after 1.6rc4 was released). The
1.6rc5 fix was not a regression, so I don't think it needs to push back the
release date.

Many thanks to all those who have been testing the release candidates, and
making sure that 1.6-final will be a high quality release.

The source code is available at:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6rc5/

bzr 1.6rc5 2008-08-19
- ---------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * Disable automatic detection of stacking based on a containing
      directory of the target. It interacted badly with push, and needs a
      bit more work to get the edges polished before it should happen
      automatically. (John Arbash Meinel, #259275)


bzr 1.6rc4 2008-08-18
- ---------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix a regression in knit => pack fetching.  We had a logic
      inversion, causing the fetch to insert fulltexts in random order,
      rather than preserving deltas.  (John Arbash Meinel, #256757)

Finally, the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released.

This release includes new features like Stacked Branches, improved weave
merge, and an updated server protocol (now on v3) which will allow for better
cross version compatibility. With this release we have deprecated Knit format
repositories, and recommend that users upgrade them, we will continue to
support reading and writing them for the forseeable future, but we will not be
tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to be better at
scaling. This will also be the first release to bundle TortoiseBzr in the
standalone Windows installer.

This was an extended release cycle, and more work than normal went into this
release. Many thanks to all the people who contributed development time, bug
reports, and polish to all parts of Bazaar. Our next release (1.7) should be
back on our normal time-based release schedule.

The source code and changelog is available at:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6/

Ubuntu packages will be available from the bzr ppa:

Release Notes for all changes since bzr 1.5:

bzr 1.6 2008-08-25
- ------------------

Finally, the long awaited bzr 1.6 has been released. This release
includes new features like Stacked Branches, improved weave merge, and
an updated server protocol (now on v3) which will allow for better cross
version compatibility. With this release we have deprecated Knit format
repositories, and recommend that users upgrade them, we will continue to
support reading and writing them for the forseeable future, but we will
not be tuning them for performance as pack repositories have proven to
be better at scaling. This will also be the first release to bundle
TortoiseBzr in the standalone Windows installer.


bzr 1.6rc5 2008-08-19
- ---------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * Disable automatic detection of stacking based on a containing
    directory of the target. It interacted badly with push, and needs a
    bit more work to get the edges polished before it should happen
    automatically. (John Arbash Meinel, #259275)


bzr 1.6rc4 2008-08-18
- ---------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix a regression in knit => pack fetching.  We had a logic
    inversion, causing the fetch to insert fulltexts in random order,
    rather than preserving deltas.  (John Arbash Meinel, #256757)


bzr 1.6rc3 2008-08-14
- ---------------------

  CHANGES:

    * Disable reading ``.bzrrules`` as a per-branch rule preferences
    file. The feature was not quite ready for a full release.  (Robert
    Collins)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Update the windows installer to bundle TortoiseBzr and ``qbzr``
    into the standalone installer. This will be the first official
    windows release that installs Tortoise by default.  (Mark Hammond)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix a regression in ``bzr+http`` support. There was a missing
    function (``_read_line``) that needed to be carried over from
    ``bzr+ssh`` support. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``GraphIndex`` objects will internally read an entire index if
    more than 1/20th of their keyspace is requested in a single
    operation.  This largely mitigates a performance regression in ``bzr
    log FILE`` and completely corrects the performance regression in
    ``bzr log``.  The regression was caused by removing an accomodation
    which had been supporting the index format in use. A newer index
    format is in development which is substantially faster. (Robert
    Collins)


bzr 1.6rc2 2008-08-13
- ---------------------

This release candidate has a few minor bug fixes, and some regression
fixes for Windows.

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr upgrade`` on remote branches accessed via bzr:// and
    bzr+ssh:// now works.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Change the ``get_format_description()`` strings for
    ``RepositoryFormatKnitPack5`` et al to be single line messages.
    (Aaron Bentley)

    * Fix for a regression on Win32 where we would try to call
    ``os.listdir()`` on a file and not catch the exception properly.
    (Windows raises a different exception.) This would manifest in
    places like ``bzr rm file`` or ``bzr switch``.  (Mark Hammond, John
    Arbash Meinel)

    * ``Inventory.copy()`` was failing to set the revision property for
    the root entry. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * sftp transport: added missing ``FileExists`` case to
    ``_translate_io_exception`` (Christophe Troestler, #123475)

    * The help for ``bzr ignored`` now suggests ``bzr ls --ignored`` for
    scripting use. (Robert Collins, #3834)

    * The default ``annotate`` logic will now always assign the
    last-modified value of a line to one of the revisions that modified
    it, rather than a merge revision. This would happen when both sides
    claimed to have modified the line resulting in the same text. The
    choice is arbitrary but stable, so merges in different directions
    will get the same results.  (John Arbash Meinel, #232188)


bzr 1.6rc1 2008-08-06
- ---------------------

This release candidate for bzr 1.6 solidifies the new branch stacking
feature.  Bazaar now recommends that users upgrade all knit
repositories, because later formats are much faster.  However, we plan
to continue read/write and upgrade support for knit repostories for the
forseeable future.  Several other bugs and performance issues were
fixed.

  CHANGES:

    * Knit format repositories are deprecated and bzr will now emit
    warnings whenever it encounters one.  Use ``bzr upgrade`` to upgrade
    knit repositories to pack format.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr check`` can now be told which elements at a location it
    should check.  (Daniel Watkins)

    * Commit now supports ``--exclude`` (or ``-x``) to exclude some
    files from the commit. (Robert Collins, #3117)

    * Fetching data between repositories that have the same model but no
    optimised fetcher will not reserialise all the revisions, increasing
    performance. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Give a more specific error when target branch is not reachable.
    (James Westby)

    * Implemented a custom ``walkdirs_utf8`` implementation for win32.
    This uses a pyrex extension to get direct access to the
    ``FindFirstFileW`` style apis, rather than using ``listdir`` +
    ``lstat``. Shows a very strong improvement in commands like
    ``status`` and ``diff`` which have to iterate the working tree.
    Anywhere from 2x-6x faster depending on the size of the tree (bigger
    trees, bigger benefit.) (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New registry for log properties handles  and the method in
    LongLogFormatter to display the custom properties returned by the
    registered handlers. (Guillermo Gonzalez, #162469)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Add more tests that stacking does not create deltas spanning
    physical repository boundaries.  (Martin Pool, #252428)

    * Better message about incompatible repositories.  (Martin Pool,
    #206258)

    * ``bzr branch --stacked`` ensures the destination branch format can
    support stacking, even if the origin does not.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr export`` no longer exports ``.bzrrules``.  (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``bzr serve --directory=/`` now correctly allows the whole
    filesystem to be accessed on Windows, not just the root of the drive
    that Python is running from.  (Adrian Wilkins, #240910)

    * Deleting directories by hand before running ``bzr rm`` will not
    cause subsequent errors in ``bzr st`` and ``bzr commit``.  (Robert
    Collins, #150438)

    * Fix a test case that was failing if encoding wasn't UTF-8.  (John
    Arbash Meinel, #247585)

    * Fix "no buffer space available" error when branching with the new
    smart server protocol to or from Windows.  (Andrew Bennetts,
    #246180)

    * Fixed problem in branching from smart server.  (#249256, Michael
    Hudson, Martin Pool)

    * Handle a file turning in to a directory in TreeTransform.  (James
    Westby, #248448)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``MutableTree.commit`` has an extra optional keywork parameter
    ``exclude`` that will be unconditionally supplied by the command
    line UI - plugins that add tree formats may need an update.  (Robert
    Collins)

    * The API minimum version for plugin compatibility has been raised
    to 1.6 - there are significant changes throughout the code base.
    (Robert Collins)

    * The generic fetch code now uses three attributes on Repository
    objects to control fetch. The streams requested are controlled via :
    ``_fetch_order`` and ``_fetch_uses_deltas``. Setting these
    appropriately allows different repository implementations to recieve
    data in their optimial form. If the ``_fetch_reconcile`` is set then
    a reconcile operation is triggered at the end of the fetch.  (Robert
    Collins)

    * The ``put_on_disk`` and ``get_tar_item`` methods in
    ``InventoryEntry`` were deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``Repository.is_shared`` doesn't take a read lock. It didn't need
    one in the first place (nobody cached the value, and
    ``RemoteRepository`` wasn't taking one either). This saves a round
    trip when probing Pack repositories, as they read the ``pack-names``
    file when locked. And during probe, locking the repo isn't very
    useful. (John Arbash Meinel)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``bzrlib.branchbuilder.BranchBuilder`` is now much more capable of
    putting together a real history without having to create a full
    WorkingTree. It is recommended that tests that are not directly
    testing the WorkingTree use BranchBuilder instead.  See
    ``BranchBuilder.build_snapshot`` or
    ``TestCaseWithMemoryTree.make_branch_builder``.  (John Arbash
    Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.builtins.internal_tree_files`` broken into two giving a
    new helper ``safe_relpath_files`` - used by the new ``exclude``
    parameter to commit. (Robert Collins)

    * Make it easier to introduce new WorkingTree formats.  (Ian
    Clatworthy)

    * The code for exporting trees was refactored not to use the
    deprecated ``InventoryEntry`` methods. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * RuleSearchers return () instead of [] now when there are no
    matches.  (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 1.6beta3 2008-07-17
- -----------------------

This release adds a new 'stacked branches' feature allowing branches to
share storage without being in the same repository or on the same
machine.  (See the user guide for more details.)  It also adds a new
hook, improved weaves, aliases for related locations, faster bzr+ssh
push, and several bug fixes.

  FEATURES:

    * New ``pre_change_branch_tip`` hook that is called before the
    branch tip is moved, while the branch is write-locked.  See the User
    Reference for signature details.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Rule-based preferences can now be defined for selected files in
    selected branches, allowing commands and plugins to provide custom
    behaviour for files matching defined patterns.  See ``Rule-based
    preferences`` (part of ``Configuring Bazaar``) in the User Guide and
    ``bzr help rules`` for more information.  (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Sites may suggest a branch to stack new branches on.  (Aaron
    Bentley)

    * Stacked branches are now supported. See ``bzr help branch`` and
    ``bzr help push``.  Branches must be in the ``development1`` format
    to stack, though the stacked-on branch can be of any format.
    (Robert Collins)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr export --format=tgz --root=NAME -`` to export a gzipped
    tarball to stdout; also ``tar`` and ``tbz2``.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr (re)merge --weave`` will now use a standard Weave algorithm,
    rather than the annotation-based merge it was using. It does so by
    building up a Weave of the important texts, without needing to build
    the full ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #238895)

    * ``bzr send`` documents and better supports ``emacsclient`` (proper
    escaping of mail headers and handling of the MUA Mew).  (Christophe
    Troestler)

    * Remembered locations can be specified by aliases, e.g. :parent,
    :public, :submit.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * The smart protocol now has improved support for setting branches'
    revision info directly.  This makes operations like push faster.
    The new request method name is ``Branch.set_last_revision_ex``.
    (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Bazaar is now able to be a client to the web server of IIS 6 and
    7.  The broken implementations of RFC822 in Python and RFC2046 in
    IIS combined with boundary-line checking in Bazaar previously made
    this impossible. (NB, IIS 5 does not suffer from this problem).
    (Adrian Wilkins, #247585)

    * ``bzr log --long`` with a ghost in your mainline now handles that
    ghost properly. (John Arbash Meinel, #243536)

    * ``check`` handles the split-up .bzr layout correctly, so no longer
    requires a branch to be present.  (Daniel Watkins, #64783)

    * Clearer message about how to set the PYTHONPATH if bzrlib can't be
    loaded.  (Martin Pool, #205230)

    * Errors about missing libraries are now shown without a traceback,
    and with a suggestion to install the library.  The full traceback is
    still in ``.bzr.log`` and can be shown with ``-Derror``.  (Martin
    Pool, #240161)

    * Fetch from a stacked branch copies all required data.  (Aaron
    Bentley, #248506)

    * Handle urls such as ftp://user@host.com@www.host.com where the
    user name contains an @.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #228058)

    * ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now suppress an error
    during ``unlock`` if there was an error in the original function.
    This helps most when there is a failure with a smart server action,
    since often the connection closes and we cannot unlock.  (Andrew
    Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #125784)

    * Obsolete hidden command ``bzr fetch`` removed.  (Martin Pool,
    #172870)

    * Raise the correct exception when doing ``-rbefore:0`` or ``-c0``.
    (John Arbash Meinel, #239933)

    * You can now compare file revisions in Windows diff programs from
    Cygwin Bazaar.  (Matt McClure, #209281)

    * revision_history now tolerates mainline ghosts for Branch format
    6.  (Aaron Bentley, #235055)

    * Set locale from environment for third party libs.  (Martin von
    Gagern, #128496)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added *Using stacked branches* to the User Guide.  (Ian
    Clatworthy)

    * Updated developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

  TESTING:

   * ``-Dmemory`` will cause /proc/PID/status to be catted before bzr
   exits, allowing low-key analysis of peak memory use. (Robert Collins)

   * ``TestCaseWithTransport.make_branch_and_tree`` tries harder to
   return a tree with a ``branch`` attribute of the right format.  This
   was preventing some ``RemoteBranch`` tests from actually running with
   ``RemoteBranch`` instances.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  API CHANGES:

    * Removed ``Repository.text_store``, ``control_store``, etc.
    Instead, there are new attributes ``texts, inventories, revisions,
    signatures``, each of which is a ``VersionedFiles``.  See the
    Repository docstring for more details.  (Robert Collins)

    * ``Branch.pull`` now accepts an ``_override_hook_target`` optional
    parameter.  If you have a subclass of ``Branch`` that overrides
    ``pull`` then you should add this parameter.  (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``bzrlib.check.check()`` has been deprecated in favour of the more
    aptly-named ``bzrlib.check.check_branch()``.  (Daniel Watkins)

    * ``Tree.print_file`` and ``Repository.print_file`` are deprecated.
    These methods are bad APIs because they write directly to
    sys.stdout.  bzrlib does not use them internally, and there are no
    direct tests for them. (Alexander Belchenko)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``cat`` command no longer uses ``Tree.print_file()`` internally.
    (Alexander Belchenko)

    * New class method
    ``BzrDir.open_containing_tree_branch_or_repository`` which eases the
    discovery of the tree, the branch and the repository containing a
    given location.  (Daniel Watkins)

    * New ``versionedfile.KeyMapper`` interface to abstract out the
    access to underlying .knit/.kndx etc files in repositories with
    partitioned storage. (Robert Collins)

    * Obsolete developer-use command ``weave-join`` has been removed.
    (Robert Collins)

    * ``RemoteToOtherFetcher`` and ``get_data_stream_for_search``
    removed, to support new ``VersionedFiles`` layering.  (Robert
    Collins)


bzr 1.6beta2 2008-06-10
- -----------------------

This release contains further progress towards our 1.6 goals of shallow
repositories, and contains a fix for some user-affecting bugs in the
repository layer.  Building working trees during checkout and branch is
now faster.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid KnitCorrupt error extracting inventories from some
    repositories.  (The data is not corrupt; an internal check is
    detecting a problem reading from the repository.) (Martin Pool,
    Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins, #234748)

    * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
    (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * Fix infinite loop consuming 100% CPU when a connection is lost
    while reading a response body via the smart protocol v1 or v2.
        (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Inserting a bundle which changes the contents of a file with no
    trailing end of line, causing a knit snapshot in a 'knits'
    repository will no longer cause KnitCorrupt. (Robert Collins)

    * ``RemoteBranch.pull`` needs to return the ``self._real_branch``'s
    pull result. It was instead just returning None, which breaks ``bzr
    pull``. (John Arbash Meinel, #238149)

    * Sanitize branch nick before using it as an attachment filename in
    ``bzr send``. (Luk Lalinsk, #210218)

    * Squash ``inv_entry.symlink_target`` to a plain string when
    generating DirState details. This prevents from getting a
    ``UnicodeError`` when you have symlinks and non-ascii filenames.
    (John Arbash Meinel, #135320)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added the 'alias' command to set/unset and display aliases. (Tim
    Penhey)

    * ``added``, ``modified``, and ``unknowns`` behaviour made
    consistent (all three now quote paths where required). Added
    ``--null`` option to ``added`` and ``modified`` (for null-separated
    unknowns, use ``ls --unknown --null``) (Adrian Wilkins)

    * Faster branching (1.09x) and lightweight checkouts (1.06x) on
    large trees.  (Ian Clatworthy, Aaron Bentley)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added *Bazaar Zen* section to the User Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

  TESTING:

    * Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while
    it is running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert
    Collins)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out
    revisions which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you
    merge the same tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing
    merge, it will only record the newest. (If you merge a descendent,
    it will replace its ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * ``RepositoryPolicy.__init__`` now requires stack_on and
    stack_on_pwd, through the derived classes do not.  (Aaron Bentley)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``bzrlib.bzrdir.BzrDir.sprout`` now accepts ``stacked`` to control
    creating stacked branches. (Robert Collins)

    * Knit record serialisation is now stricter on what it will accept,
    to guard against potential internal bugs, or broken input. (Robert
    Collins)


bzr 1.6beta1 2008-06-02
- -----------------------


Commands that work on the revision history such as push, pull, missing,
uncommit and log are now substantially faster.  This release adds a
translation of some of the user documentation into Spanish.
(Contributions of other translations would be very welcome.)  Bazaar
1.6beta1 adds a new network protocol which is used by default and which
allows for more efficient transfers and future extensions.


  NOTES WHEN UPGRADING:

    * There is a new version of the network protocol used for bzr://,
    bzr+ssh:// and bzr+http:// connections.  This will allow more
    efficient requests and responses, and more graceful fallback when a
    server is too old to recognise a request from a more recent client.
    Bazaar 1.6 will interoperate with 0.16 and later versions, but
    servers should be upgraded when possible.  Bazaar 1.6 no longer
    interoperates with 0.15 and earlier via these protocols.  Use
    alternatives like SFTP or upgrade those servers.  (Andrew Bennetts,
    #83935)

  CHANGES:

    * Deprecation warnings will not be suppressed when running ``bzr
    selftest`` so that developers can see if their code is using
    deprecated functions.  (John Arbash Meinel)

  FEATURES:

    * Adding ``-Derror`` will now display a traceback when a plugin
    fails to load. (James Westby)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr branch/push/pull -r XXX`` now have a helper function for
    finding the revno of the new revision
    (``Graph.find_distance_to_null``). This should make something like
    ``bzr branch -r -100`` in a shared, no-trees repository much
    snappier. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr log --short -r X..Y`` no longer needs to access the full
    revision history. This makes it noticeably faster when logging the
    last few revisions. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr ls`` now accepts ``-V`` as an alias for ``--versioned``.
    (Jerad Cramp, #165086)

    * ``bzr missing`` uses the new ``Graph.find_unique_ancestors`` and
    ``Graph.find_differences`` to determine missing revisions without
    having to search the whole ancestry. (John Arbash Meinel, #174625)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` now uses partial history access, rather than
    always extracting the full revision history for a branch. This makes
    it resolve the appropriate revisions much faster (in testing it
    drops uncommit from 1.5s => 0.4s). It also means ``bzr log --short``
    is one step closer to not using full revision history.  (John Arbash
    Meinel, #172649)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``bzr merge --lca`` should handle when two revisions have no
    common ancestor other than NULL_REVISION. (John Arbash Meinel,
    #235715)

    * ``bzr status`` was breaking if you merged the same revision twice.
    (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * ``bzr push`` with both ``--overwrite`` and ``-r NNN`` options no
    longer fails.  (Andrew Bennetts, #234229)

    * Correctly track the base URL of a smart medium when using
    bzr+http:// URLs, which was causing spurious "No repository present"
    errors with branches in shared repositories accessed over bzr+http.
    (Andrew Bennetts, #230550)

    * Define ``_remote_is_at_least_1_2`` on ``SmartClientMedium`` so
    that all implementations have the attribute.  Fixes
    'PyCurlTransport' object has no attribute '_remote_is_at_least_1_2'
    attribute errors.  (Andrew Bennetts, #220806)

    * Failure to delete an obsolete pack file should just give a warning
    message, not a fatal error.  It may for example fail if the file is
    still in use by another process.  (Martin Pool)

    * Fix MemoryError during large fetches over HTTP by limiting the
    amount of data we try to read per ``recv`` call.  The problem was
    observed with Windows and a proxy, but might affect other
    environments as well.  (Eric Holmberg, #215426)

    * Handle old merge directives correctly in Merger.from_mergeable.
    Stricter get_parent_map requirements exposed a latent bug here.
    (Aaron Bentley)

    * Issue a warning and ignore passwords declared in
    authentication.conf when used for an ssh scheme (sftp or bzr+ssh).
    (Vincent Ladeuil, #203186)

    * Make both http implementations raise appropriate exceptions on 403
    Forbidden when POSTing smart requests.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #230223)

    * Properly *title* header names in http requests instead of
    capitalizing them.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #229076)

    * The "Unable to obtain lock" error message now also suggests using
    ``bzr break-lock`` to fix it.  (Martin Albisetti, #139202)

    * Treat an encoding of '' as ascii; this can happen when bzr is run
    under vim on Mac OS X.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

    * ``VersionedFile.make_mpdiffs()`` was raising an exception that
    wasn't in scope. (Daniel Fischer #235687)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Added directory structure and started translation of docs in
    spanish.  (Martin Albisetti, Lucio Albenga)

    * Incorporate feedback from Jelmer Vernooij and Neil
    Martinsen-Burrell on the plugin and integration chapters of the User
    Guide.  (Ian Clatworthy)

    * More Bazaar developer documentation about packaging and release
    process, and about use of Python reprs.  (Martin Pool, Martin
    Albisetti)

    * Updated Tortise strategy document. (Mark Hammond)

  TESTING:

    * ``bzrlib.tests.adapt_tests`` was broken and unused - it has been
    fixed.  (Robert Collins)

    * Fix the test HTTPServer to be isolated from chdir calls made while
    it is running, allowing it to be used in blackbox tests. (Robert
    Collins)

    * New helper function for splitting test suites
    ``split_suite_by_condition``. (Robert Collins)

  INTERNALS:

    * ``Branch.missing_revisions`` has been deprecated. Similar
    functionality can be obtained using
    ``bzrlib.missing.find_unmerged``. The api was fairly broken, and the
    function was unused, so we are getting rid of it.  (John Arbash
    Meinel)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``Branch.abspath`` is deprecated; use the Tree or Transport
    instead.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``Branch.update_revisions`` now takes an optional ``Graph``
    object. This can be used by ``update_revisions`` when it is checking
    ancestry, and allows callers to prefer request to go to a local
    branch.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Branch, Repository, Tree and BzrDir should expose a Transport as
    an attribute if they have one, rather than having it indirectly
    accessible as ``.control_files._transport``.  This doesn't add a
    requirement to support a Transport in cases where it was not needed
    before; it just simplifies the way it is reached.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr missing --mine-only`` will return status code 0 if you have
    no new revisions, but the remote does. Similarly for
    ``--theirs-only``.  The new code only checks one side, so it doesn't
    know if the other side has changes. This seems more accurate with
    the request anyway.  It also changes the output to print
    '[This|Other] branch is up to date.' rather than displaying nothing.
    (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``LockableFiles.put_utf8``, ``put_bytes`` and ``controlfilename``
    are now deprecated in favor of using Transport operations.  (Martin
    Pool)

    * Many methods on ``VersionedFile``, ``Repository`` and in
    ``bzrlib.revision``  deprecated before bzrlib 1.5 have been removed.
    (Robert Collins)

    * ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` can be set to False for a
    given ``RevisionSpec``. This will disable the existing behavior of
    passing in the full revision history to ``self._match_on``. Useful
    for specs that don't actually need access to the full history. (John
        Arbash Meinel)

    * The constructors of ``SmartClientMedium`` and its subclasses now
    require a ``base`` parameter.  ``SmartClientMedium`` implementations
    now also need to provide a ``remote_path_from_transport`` method.
    (Andrew Bennetts)

    * The default permissions for creating new files and directories
    should now be obtained from ``BzrDir._get_file_mode()`` and
    ``_get_dir_mode()``, rather than from LockableFiles.  The
    ``_set_file_mode`` and ``_set_dir_mode`` variables on LockableFiles
    which were advertised as a way for plugins to control this are no
    longer consulted.  (Martin Pool)

    * ``VersionedFile.join`` is deprecated. This method required local
    instances of both versioned file objects and was thus hostile to
    being used for streaming from a smart server. The new
    get_record_stream and insert_record_stream are meant to efficiently
    replace this method.  (Robert Collins)

    * ``WorkingTree.set_parent_(ids/trees)`` will now filter out
    revisions which are in the ancestry of other revisions. So if you
    merge the same tree twice, or merge an ancestor of an existing
    merge, it will only record the newest. (If you merge a descendent,
    it will replace its ancestor). (John Arbash Meinel, #235407)

    * ``WorkingTreeFormat2.stub_initialize_remote`` is now private.
    (Martin Pool)

I'm happy to announce the second release candidate for version 0.4.12 of
bzr-svn. It improves performance in some areas, fixes some bugs and
adds a --incremental option to svn-import.

The list of changes since the previous rc is:

CHANGES

   * Fix setup.py run with python2.4. (#256804)

   * Use rst2html.py rather than rst2html if it is available.

  BUG FIXES

   * Parse http redirect errors in some non-English locales better.

   * Avoid importing tags as branches in svn-import, now that tags are 
     converted to native Bazaar tags.

  FEATURES

   * svn-import will now remove branches removed in Subversion. 
     (#246243). The --keep option can be specified to keep 
	 branches removed in Subversion around.

   * Add --incremental option to bzr-svn for incremental imports.

   * Set revision properties from v3 mappings when possible.
     (#127736)

   * Create tags base directory if it doesn't exist.

   * Add --merged option to svn-push command.

The tarball can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.11~rc2.tar.gz

A GPG signature, made with my key, can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.11~rc2.tar.gz.asc

Please file bugs in Launchpad, so they can be fixed before the final
release:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+filebug

If there are particular bugs or regressions you think should be fixed
before the final release, please let me know.

I hope to release the final version of 0.4.11 in a couple of days.

Cheers,

Jelmer

Following the "release early, release often" philosophy, we have yet another
release candidate for you to test.

This release fixes a few regressions found in the 1.6 client. Fetching changes
was using an O(N^2) buffering algorithm, so for large projects it would cause
memory thrashing. There is also a specific problem with the --1.6-rich-root
format, which prevented stacking on top of --rich-root-pack repositories, and
could allow users to accidentally fetch experimental data (-subtree) without
representing it properly. The --1.6-rich-root format has been deprecated and
users are recommended to upgrade to --1.6.1-rich-root immediately.  Also we
re-introduced a workaround for users who have repositories with incorrect
nodes (not possible if you only used official releases). I should also clarify
that none of this is data loss level issues, but still sufficient enough to
warrant an updated release.

Thanks go out to the people who upgraded to bzr 1.6 and discovered these
issues and reported them in a timely fashion.


The source code is available at:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6.1rc1/

Ubuntu packages are available from the beta ppa:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr-beta-ppa/+archive

Windows and Mac installers should be available soon from:
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download

If no other regressions are found, 1.6.1 final should be released by Friday,
Sept 5th. (I'm likely to release -final a little bit early for this round.)

An update to the 1.6 release has just been made final. The 1.6 release had a
couple of issues that necessitated cutting a 1.6.1 release. A bit of
performance tweaking, and a bit of stacked and rich-root repository polishing.
Users who tried out '--1.6-rich-root' are requested to upgrade to
'--1.6.1-rich-root' which is what the original format was meant to be (it
properly stacks on other rich-root formats, and won't accidentally allow
'subtree' data.)

The source code is available at:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.6/1.6.1
Windows and Mac installers should be available shortly.

Ubuntu packages have already been uploaded to the bzr stable ppa at:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive

Thanks to those who were using 1.6 and exposed some edge cases that needed to
be fixed.

John

Release Notes for all changes since bzr 1.6:


bzr 1.6.1 2008-09-05
- --------------------

A couple regressions were found in the 1.6 release. There was a
performance issue when using ``bzr+ssh`` to branch large repositories,
and some problems with stacking and ``rich-root`` capable repositories.


bzr 1.6.1rc2 2008-09-03
- -----------------------

  BUG FIXES:

    * Copying between ``rich-root`` and ``rich-root-pack`` (and vice
      versa) was accidentally using the inter-model fetcher, instead of
      recognizing that both were 'rich root' formats.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #264321)


bzr 1.6.1rc1 2008-08-29
- -----------------------

This release fixes a few regressions found in the 1.6 client. Fetching
changes was using an O(N^2) buffering algorithm, so for large projects it
would cause memory thrashing. There is also a specific problem with the
``--1.6-rich-root`` format, which prevented stacking on top of
``--rich-root-pack`` repositories, and could allow users to accidentally
fetch experimental data (``-subtree``) without representing it properly.
The ``--1.6-rich-root`` format has been deprecated and users are
recommended to upgrade to ``--1.6.1-rich-root`` immediately.  Also we
re-introduced a workaround for users who have repositories with incorrect
nodes (not possible if you only used official releases).
I should also clarify that none of this is data loss level issues, but
still sufficient enough to warrant an updated release.

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``RemoteTransport.readv()`` was being inefficient about how it
      buffered the readv data and processed it. It would keep appending to
      the same string (causing many copies) and then pop bytes out of the
      start of the string (causing more copies).
      With this patch "bzr+ssh://local" can improve dramatically,
      especially for projects with large files.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Revision texts were always meant to be stored as fulltexts. There
      was a bug in a bzr.dev version that would accidentally create deltas
      when copying from a Pack repo to a Knit repo. This has been fixed,
      but to support those repositories, we know always request full texts
      for Revision texts. (John Arbash Meinel, #261339)

    * The previous ``--1.6-rich-root`` format used an incorrect xml
      serializer, which would accidentally support fetching from a
      repository that supported subtrees, even though the local one would
      not. We deprecated that format, and introduced a new one that uses
      the correct serializer ``--1.6.1-rich-root``.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #262333)

This release candidate for bzr 1.7 has several bug fixes and a few performance
and feature improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for missing files and
remove them, like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown files and adds them. A bit
more polish has been applied to the stacking code. The b-tree indexing code
has been brought in, with an eye on using it in a future repository format.

If no regressions are found in this release, bzr 1.7 final should be released
next Monday, Sept 15th, 2008.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.

As always, the source is available directly, and Windows and Mac downloads
should be available shortly.

The packages should be building right now in the beta ppa:

Release Notes for all changes since bzr 1.6.1:

bzr 1.7rc1 2008-09-09
- ---------------------

This release candidate for bzr 1.7 has several bug fixes and a few
performance and feature improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for
missing files and remove them, like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown
files and adds them. A bit more polish has been applied to the stacking
code. The b-tree indexing code has been brought in, with an eye on using
it in a future repository format.


  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr export`` can now export a subdirectory of a project.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr rm`` will now scan for files that are missing and remove just
      them automatically, much as ``bzr add`` scans for new files that
      are not ignored and adds them automatically. (Robert Collins)

  FEATURES

    * Support for GSSAPI authentication when using FTP as documented in
      RFC2228. (Jelmer Vernooij, #49623)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * A url like ``log+file:///tmp`` will log all access to that Transport
      to ``.bzr.log``, which may help in debugging or profiling.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr branch`` and ``bzr push`` use the default stacking policy if the
      branch format supports it. (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr init`` and ``bzr init-repo`` will now print out the same as
      ``bzr info`` if it completed successfully.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` logs the old tip revision id, and displays how to
      restore the branch to that tip using ``bzr pull``.  This allows you
      to recover if you realize you uncommitted the wrong thing.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``SFTPTransport.readv()`` was accidentally using ``list += string``,
      which 'works', but adds each character separately to the list,
      rather than using ``list.append(string)``. Fixing this makes the
      SFTP transport a little bit faster (~20%) and use a bit less memory.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * When reading index files, if we happen to read the whole file in a
      single request treat it as a ``_buffer_all`` request. This happens
      most often on small indexes over remote transports, where we default
      to reading 64kB. It saves a round trip for each small index during
      fetch operations. Also, if we have read more than 50% of an index
      file, trigger a ``_buffer_all`` on the next request. This works
      around some inefficiencies because reads don't fall neatly on page
      boundaries, so we would ignore those bytes, but request them again
      later. This could trigger a total read size of more than the whole
      file. (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr rm`` is now aliased to ``bzr del`` for the convenience of svn
      users. (Robert Collins, #205416)

    * Catch the infamous "select/poll returned error" which occurs when
      pycurl try to send a body request to an HTTP/1.0 server which has
      already refused to handle the request. (Vincent Ladeuil, #225020)

    * Fix ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors when using various commands
      (including ``bzr cat`` and ``bzr annotate``) in combination with a
      smart server URL.  (Andrew Bennetts, #237067)

    * ``FTPTransport.stat()`` would return ``0000`` as the permission bits
      for the containing ``.bzr/`` directory (it does not implement
      permissions). This would cause us to set all subdirectories to
      ``0700`` and files to ``0600`` rather than leaving them unmodified.
      Now we ignore ``0000`` as the permissions and assume they are
      invalid. (John Arbash Meinel, #259855)

    * Merging from a previously joined branch will no longer cause
      a traceback. (Jelmer Vernooij, #203376)

    * Pack operations on windows network shares will work even with large
      files. (Robert Collins, #255656)

    * Running ``bzr st PATH_TO_TREE`` will no longer suppress merge
      status. Status is also about 7% faster on mozilla sized trees
      when the path to the root of the tree has been given. Users of
      the internal ``show_tree_status`` function should be aware that
      the show_pending flag is now authoritative for showing pending
      merges, as it was originally. (Robert Collins, #225204)

    * Set valid default _param_name for Option so that ListOption can embed
      '-' in names. (Vincent Ladeuil, #263249)

    * Show proper error rather than traceback when an unknown revision
      id is specified to ``bzr cat-revision``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #175569)

    * Trailing text in the dirstate file could cause the C dirstate parser
      to try to allocate an invalid amount of memory. We now properly
      check and test for parsing a dirstate with invalid trailing data.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #186014)

    * Unexpected error responses from a smart server no longer cause the
      client to traceback.  (Andrew Bennetts, #263527)

    * Use a Windows api function to get a Unicode host name, rather than
      assuming the host name is ascii.
      (Mark Hammond, John Arbash Meinel, #256550)

    * ``WorkingTree4`` trees will now correctly report missing-and-new
      paths in the output of ``iter_changes``. (Robert Collins)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Updated developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

  API CHANGES:

    * Exporters now take 4 parameters. (Robert Collins)

    * ``Tree.iter_changes`` will now return False for the content change
      field when a file is missing in the basis tree and not present in
      the target tree. Previously it returned True unconditionally.
      (Robert Collins)

    * The deprecated ``Branch.abspath`` and unimplemented
      ``Branch.rename_one`` and ``Branch.move`` were removed. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * BzrDir.clone_on_transport implementations must now accept a stacked_on
      parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * BzrDir.cloning_metadir implementations must now take a require_stacking
      parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

  TESTING:

    * ``addCleanup`` now takes ``*arguments`` and ``**keyword_arguments``
      which are then passed to the cleanup callable as it is run. In
      addition, addCleanup no longer requires that the callables passed to
      it be unique. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Fix some tests that fail on Windows because files are deleted while
      still in use.
      (Mark Hammond)

    * ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option can now use predefined
      prefixes so that one can say ``bzr selftest -s bp.loom`` instead of
      ``bzr selftest -s bzrlib.plugins.loom``. (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option now accepts multiple values.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

  INTERNALS:

    * A new plugin interface, ``bzrlib.log.log_adapters``, has been added.
      This allows dynamic log output filtering by plugins.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.btree_index`` is now available, providing a b-tree index
      layer. The design is memory conservative (limited memory cache),
      faster to seek (approx 100 nodes per page, gives 100-way fan out),
      and stores compressed pages allowing more keys per page.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.diff.DiffTree.show_diff`` now skips changes where the kind
      is unknown in both source and target.
      (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley)

    * ``GraphIndexBuilder.add_node`` and ``BTreeBuilder`` have been
      streamlined a bit. This should make creating large indexes faster.
      (In benchmarking, it now takes less time to create a BTree index than
      it takes to read the GraphIndex one.) (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Mail clients for `bzr send` are now listed in a registry.  This
      allows plugins to add new clients by registering them with
      ``bzrlib.mail_client.mail_client_registry``.  All of the built-in
      clients now use this mechanism.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

Hear ye, hear ye. Come one, come all to the newest release candidate for
Bazaar 1.7.

This release has fairly minor changes from the 1.7rc1, but enough that we want
 a bit of real-world testing before we release 1.7-final. The biggest change
is a new RemoteBranch.get_stacked_on_url rpc. This allows clients that are
trying to access a Stacked branch over the smart protocol, to properly
connect to the stacked-on location.

The current plan is to release 1.7 final on Monday, Sept 22nd.

The tarball has been uploaded to
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.7/1.7rc2

And the packages have been sent to the bzr beta ppa:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr-beta-ppa/+archive

I would assume the Mac OS X and Windows installers will be available shortly,
though I won't guarantee they will get built before 1.7 final is out on Monday.

John

Release Notes for 1.7rc2:

bzr 1.7rc2 2008-09-17
- ---------------------

A few bug fixes from 1.7rc1. The biggest change is a new
``RemoteBranch.get_stacked_on_url`` rpc. This allows clients that are
trying to access a Stacked branch over the smart protocol, to properly
connect to the stacked-on location.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
      repository now preserves the repository format.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

   * Branching from a stacked branch via ``bzr+ssh`` can properly connect
     to the stacked-on branch.  (Martin Pool, #261315)

    * ``bzr init`` no longer re-opens the BzrDir multiple times.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm pleased to announce
new shiny release QBzr 0.9.4!

	https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.9.4

This release provide many new features and new commands,
and many improvements and bugfixes to existing commands.

New commands, similar to standard bzr commands:
 qadd, qinfo, qinit, qmerge and qrevert

New 'hybrid' commands:
 qgetnew, qgetupdates, qinit

Hybrid commands provide universal interface to several similar
bzr functions in one dialog and supposed to be configurable
via dialog options.

This release is also contains next improvements: all q-commands
now lazily registered to reduce the bzr startup time penalty;
autocompleter in qcommit now understand more programming languages,
not only C/Python; qcommit trying to spell check your commit message,
if you have PyEnchant installed; qannotate and qdiff(!) highlight
syntax of source code files; qlog can use bzr-search plugin for
searching in history; qlog can show combinated history for several
files from one branch or even for several branches from one shared repository.

The list of most user-visible changes since 0.9.3 see below.

Thanks
******
Many thanks to all people who contribute code, patches, report about bugs and provide other useful
feedback.

Special thanks to Mark Hammond who start contribute new design and code. He tried to converge
various bzr workflows/options/commands in universal dialogs to simplify usage of TortoiseBzr. Check
out new hybrid commands ;-)

Now QBzr is not only plain GUI bzr plugin that provide q-commands for CLI,
but also used as part of TortoiseBzr and in QBzr-Eclipse (written by Nicholas Allen).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Thanks to everyone's support, 1.7 final has now arrived.

This isn't quite as spectacular a release as the 1.6, but it is *almost* on
time. :) We slipped a week, but at least we didn't slip a month (or more).

This release includes many bug fixes and a few performance and feature
improvements.  "bzr rm" will now scan for missing files and remove them,
similar to ``bzr add`` with unknown files. A bit more polish has been applied
to the stacking code. The b-tree indexing code has been brought in, with an
eye on using it in a future repository format.

The source code and installers are available (or will be available soon) from:
https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.7/1.7/

Ubuntu packages will be available from the bzr ppa:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive

Release Notes for all changes in bzr 1.7:

bzr 1.7 2008-09-23
- ------------------

This release includes many bug fixes and a few performance and feature
improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for missing files and remove them,
like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown files and adds them. A bit more
polish has been applied to the stacking code. The b-tree indexing code has
been brought in, with an eye on using it in a future repository format.
There are only minor installer changes since bzr-1.7rc2.

  FEATURES

    * Some small updates to the win32 installer. Include localization
      files found in plugins, and include the builtin distutils as part of
      packaging qbzr. (Mark Hammond)


bzr 1.7rc2 2008-09-17
- ---------------------

A few bug fixes from 1.7rc1. The biggest change is a new
``RemoteBranch.get_stacked_on_url`` rpc. This allows clients that are
trying to access a Stacked branch over the smart protocol, to properly
connect to the stacked-on location.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
      repository now preserves the repository format.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

   * Branching from a stacked branch via ``bzr+ssh`` can properly connect
     to the stacked-on branch.  (Martin Pool, #261315)

    * ``bzr init`` no longer re-opens the BzrDir multiple times.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
      (Andrew Bennetts)


bzr 1.7rc1 2008-09-09
- ---------------------

This release candidate for bzr 1.7 has several bug fixes and a few
performance and feature improvements.  ``bzr rm`` will now scan for
missing files and remove them, like how ``bzr add`` scans for unknown
files and adds them. A bit more polish has been applied to the stacking
code. The b-tree indexing code has been brought in, with an eye on using
it in a future repository format.


  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr export`` can now export a subdirectory of a project.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzr rm`` will now scan for files that are missing and remove just
      them automatically, much as ``bzr add`` scans for new files that
      are not ignored and adds them automatically. (Robert Collins)

  FEATURES

    * Support for GSSAPI authentication when using FTP as documented in
      RFC2228. (Jelmer Vernooij, #49623)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * A url like ``log+file:///tmp`` will log all access to that Transport
      to ``.bzr.log``, which may help in debugging or profiling.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ``bzr branch`` and ``bzr push`` use the default stacking policy if the
      branch format supports it. (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``bzr init`` and ``bzr init-repo`` will now print out the same as
      ``bzr info`` if it completed successfully.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzr uncommit`` logs the old tip revision id, and displays how to
      restore the branch to that tip using ``bzr pull``.  This allows you
      to recover if you realize you uncommitted the wrong thing.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Fix problems in accessing stacked repositories over ``bzr://``.
      (Martin Pool, #261315)

    * ``SFTPTransport.readv()`` was accidentally using ``list += string``,
      which 'works', but adds each character separately to the list,
      rather than using ``list.append(string)``. Fixing this makes the
      SFTP transport a little bit faster (~20%) and use a bit less memory.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * When reading index files, if we happen to read the whole file in a
      single request treat it as a ``_buffer_all`` request. This happens
      most often on small indexes over remote transports, where we default
      to reading 64kB. It saves a round trip for each small index during
      fetch operations. Also, if we have read more than 50% of an index
      file, trigger a ``_buffer_all`` on the next request. This works
      around some inefficiencies because reads don't fall neatly on page
      boundaries, so we would ignore those bytes, but request them again
      later. This could trigger a total read size of more than the whole
      file. (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr rm`` is now aliased to ``bzr del`` for the convenience of svn
      users. (Robert Collins, #205416)

    * Catch the infamous "select/poll returned error" which occurs when
      pycurl try to send a body request to an HTTP/1.0 server which has
      already refused to handle the request. (Vincent Ladeuil, #225020)

    * Fix ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors when using various commands
      (including ``bzr cat`` and ``bzr annotate``) in combination with a
      smart server URL.  (Andrew Bennetts, #237067)

    * ``FTPTransport.stat()`` would return ``0000`` as the permission bits
      for the containing ``.bzr/`` directory (it does not implement
      permissions). This would cause us to set all subdirectories to
      ``0700`` and files to ``0600`` rather than leaving them unmodified.
      Now we ignore ``0000`` as the permissions and assume they are
      invalid. (John Arbash Meinel, #259855)

    * Merging from a previously joined branch will no longer cause
      a traceback. (Jelmer Vernooij, #203376)

    * Pack operations on windows network shares will work even with large
      files. (Robert Collins, #255656)

    * Running ``bzr st PATH_TO_TREE`` will no longer suppress merge
      status. Status is also about 7% faster on mozilla sized trees
      when the path to the root of the tree has been given. Users of
      the internal ``show_tree_status`` function should be aware that
      the show_pending flag is now authoritative for showing pending
      merges, as it was originally. (Robert Collins, #225204)

    * Set valid default _param_name for Option so that ListOption can embed
      '-' in names. (Vincent Ladeuil, #263249)

    * Show proper error rather than traceback when an unknown revision
      id is specified to ``bzr cat-revision``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #175569)

    * Trailing text in the dirstate file could cause the C dirstate parser
      to try to allocate an invalid amount of memory. We now properly
      check and test for parsing a dirstate with invalid trailing data.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #186014)

    * Unexpected error responses from a smart server no longer cause the
      client to traceback.  (Andrew Bennetts, #263527)

    * Use a Windows api function to get a Unicode host name, rather than
      assuming the host name is ascii.
      (Mark Hammond, John Arbash Meinel, #256550)

    * ``WorkingTree4`` trees will now correctly report missing-and-new
      paths in the output of ``iter_changes``. (Robert Collins)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Updated developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

  API CHANGES:

    * Exporters now take 4 parameters. (Robert Collins)

    * ``Tree.iter_changes`` will now return False for the content change
      field when a file is missing in the basis tree and not present in
      the target tree. Previously it returned True unconditionally.
      (Robert Collins)

    * The deprecated ``Branch.abspath`` and unimplemented
      ``Branch.rename_one`` and ``Branch.move`` were removed. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * BzrDir.clone_on_transport implementations must now accept a stacked_on
      parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * BzrDir.cloning_metadir implementations must now take a require_stacking
      parameter.  (Aaron Bentley)

  TESTING:

    * ``addCleanup`` now takes ``*arguments`` and ``**keyword_arguments``
      which are then passed to the cleanup callable as it is run. In
      addition, addCleanup no longer requires that the callables passed to
      it be unique. (Jonathan Lange)

    * Fix some tests that fail on Windows because files are deleted while
      still in use.
      (Mark Hammond)

    * ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option can now use predefined
      prefixes so that one can say ``bzr selftest -s bp.loom`` instead of
      ``bzr selftest -s bzrlib.plugins.loom``. (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``selftest``'s ``--starting-with`` option now accepts multiple values.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

  INTERNALS:

    * A new plugin interface, ``bzrlib.log.log_adapters``, has been added.
      This allows dynamic log output filtering by plugins.
      (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.btree_index`` is now available, providing a b-tree index
      layer. The design is memory conservative (limited memory cache),
      faster to seek (approx 100 nodes per page, gives 100-way fan out),
      and stores compressed pages allowing more keys per page.
      (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.diff.DiffTree.show_diff`` now skips changes where the kind
      is unknown in both source and target.
      (Robert Collins, Aaron Bentley)

    * ``GraphIndexBuilder.add_node`` and ``BTreeBuilder`` have been
      streamlined a bit. This should make creating large indexes faster.
      (In benchmarking, it now takes less time to create a BTree index than
      it takes to read the GraphIndex one.) (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Mail clients for `bzr send` are now listed in a registry.  This
      allows plugins to add new clients by registering them with
      ``bzrlib.mail_client.mail_client_registry``.  All of the built-in
      clients now use this mechanism.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

I'm pleased to announce the release of bzr-eclipse 1.1.0.

This new build adopts new version numbering to follow eclipse guidelines.

I want to give a thanks to the various contributors that helped
contributing bug fixes, enhancements, ideas, etc:
 * Adrian Wilkins
 * Craig Hewetson
 * Johan Walles
 * Nicholas Allen
 * Niklas Andersson
 * And all others that submitted bugs, questions, and helped to debug in
different platforms.


The highlights of this release are:

* support for branching directly from a project (into a new project)
* option to limit the number of revisions to fetch in History/log related views
* checkout support
* fixed: 264378,  258113, 271170, 271345 273957
* Improved revert support
 - added option to apply the revert to the whole branch not only the
specified files
 - fix options handling (forget-merges, no backup, etc)
* Improvements in commit dialog when committing a merge
 - a tabbed panel shows the changed files and the pending merges
 - ignore the unknown resources

I'm please to announce a new release of bzr-xmloutput plugin.

In this release the code of xmlstatus was updated to use more up to
date API from bzrlib.
Also the run_bzr method in the xmlrpc service wraps the stdout in a
xmlrpclib.Binary instance
to avoid problems with xml parsers in the client.

Regards,

-- Guillermo

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

As a minor update from bzr 1.7, 1.7.1 is being released. The only change in
this release from 1.7 is the addition of the "LCA Tree Shape" patch. This only
effects users who are doing "bzr merge" with trees that have complex history
(criss-cross merges), and complex path manipulation.

Thanks again to everyone who helped with this patch.

John
=:->

Release Notes for all changes in bzr 1.7.1:

bzr 1.7.1 2008-10-01
- --------------------

  No changes from 1.7.1rc1.


bzr 1.7.1rc1 2008-09-24
- -----------------------

This release just includes an update to how the merge algorithm handles
file paths when we encounter complex history.

  FEATURES:

    * If we encounter a criss-cross in history, use information from
      direct Least Common Ancestors to resolve inventory shape (locations
      of files, adds, deletes, etc). This is similar in concept to using
      ``--lca`` for merging file texts, only applied to paths.

I'm happy to announce bzr 1.8rc1, which should gets us back onto a
regular monthly schedule, and includes useful improvements to working
tree speed (eg bzr status), networking, merge, and log.

A source tarball is available now from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download>; other formats will follow shortly.
Your help in testing it is much appreciated, as we will do the final
release at the start of next week.

--------------

bzr 1.8rc1 2008-10-07
---------------------

Bazaar 1.8 includes several fixes that improve working tree performance,
display of revision logs, and merges.  We've also fixed, and the bzr
testsuite now passes on OS X and Python 2.6, and almost completely passes
on Windows.  The smartserver code has gained several bug fixes and
performance improvements, and can now run server-side hooks within an http
server.

  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr log file`` has been changed. It now uses a different method
      for determining which revisions to show as merging the changes to
      the file. It now only shows revisions which merged the change
      towards your mainline. This simplifies the output, makes it faster,
      and reduces memory consumption.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr merge`` now defaults to having ``--reprocess`` set, whenever
      ``--show-base`` is not supplied.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr+http//`` will now optionally load plugins and write logs on the
      server. (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzrlib._dirstate_helpers_c.pyx`` does not compile correctly with
      Pyrex 0.9.4.1 (it generates C code which causes segfaults). We
      explicitly blacklist that version of the compiler for that
      extension. Packaged versions will include .c files created with
      pyrex >=3D 0.9.6 so it doesn't effect releases, only users running
      from the source tree. (John Arbash Meinel, #276868)

  FEATURES

    * bzr is now compatible with python-2.6. python-2.6 is not yet official=
ly
      supported (nor released, tests were conducted with the dev version of
      python-2.6rc2), but all known problems have been fixed.  Feedback
      welcome.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #269535)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr annotate`` will now include uncommitted changes from the local
      working tree by default. Such uncommitted changes are given the
      revision number they would get if a commit was done, followed with a
      ? to indicate that its not actually known. (Robert Collins, #3439)

    * ``bzr branch`` now accepts a ``--standalone`` option, which creates a
      standalone branch regardless of the presence of shared repositories.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * ``bzr push`` is faster in the case there are no new revisions to
      push.  It is also faster if there are no tags in the local branch.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * File changes during a commit will update the tree stat cache.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Location aliases can now accept a trailing path.  (Micheal Hudson)

    * New hooks ``Lock.hooks`` when LockDirs are acquired and released.
      (Robert Collins, MartinPool)

    * Switching in heavyweight checkouts uses the master branch's context, =
not
      the checkout's context.  (Adrian Wilkins)

    * ``status`` on large trees is now faster, due to optimisations in the
      walkdirs code. Of particular note, the walkdirs code now performs
      a temporary ``chdir()`` while reading a single directory; if your
      platform has non thread-local current working directories (and is
      not windows which has its own implementation), this may introduce a
      race condition during concurrent uses of bzrlib. The bzrlib CLI
      will not encounter this as it is single threaded for working tree
      operations. (Robert Collins)

    * The C extensions now build on python 2.4 (Robert Collins, #271939)

    * The ``-Dhpss`` debug flag now reports the number of smart server
      calls per medium to stderr.  This is in addition to the existing
      detailed logging to the .bzr.log trace file.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid random failures arising from misinterpreted ``errno`` values
      in ``_readdir_pyx.read_dir``.
      (Martin Pool, #279381)

    * Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
      repository now preserves the repository format.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

    * ``bzr log`` now accepts a ``--change`` option.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #248427)

    * ``bzr missing`` now accepts an ``--include-merges`` option.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #233817)

    * Don't try to filter (internally) '.bzr' from the files to be deleted =
if
      it's not there.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #272648)

    * Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Fix TooManyConcurrentRequests errors caused by a connection failure
      when doing ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from a ``bzr+ssh`` URL.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #246233)

    * Fixed ``bzr st -r branch:PATH_TO_BRANCH`` where the other branch
      is in a different repository than the current one.
      (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD, #144421)

    * Make the first line of the manpage preamble a comment again.
      (David Futcher, #242106)

    * Remove use of optional parameter in GSSAPI FTP support, since
      it breaks newer versions of Python-Kerberos. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * The autopacking logic will now always create a single new pack from
      all of the content which it deems is worth moving. This avoids the
      'repack a single pack' bug and should result in better packing
      overall.  (John Arbash Meinel, #242510, #172644)

    * Trivial documentation fix.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #270471)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Explain revision/range identifiers. (Daniel Clemente)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` returns one more element in
      its result tuple - an optional file system hash for the hash cache
      to use. (Robert Collins)

    * ``dirstate.DirState.update_entry`` will now only calculate the sha1
      of a file if it is likely to be needed in determining the output
      of iter_changes. (Robert Collins)

    * The PackRepository, RepositoryPackCollection, NewPack classes have a
      slightly changed interface to support different index types; as a
      result other users of these classes need to supply the index types
      they want. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * ``bzrlib.tests.repository_implementations`` has been renamed to
      ``bzrlib.tests.per_repository`` so that we have a common structure
      (and it is shorter). (John Arbash Meinel, #239343)

    * ``LocalTransport.abspath()`` now returns a drive letter if the
      transport has one, fixing numerous tests on Windows.
      (Mark Hammond)

    * PreviewTree is now tested via intertree_implementations.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * The full test suite is passing again on OSX.
      (Guillermo Gonzalez, Vincent Ladeuil)

    * The full test suite passes when run with ``-Eallow_debug``.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

  INTERNALS:

    * A new hook, ``Branch.open``, has been added, which is called when
      branch objects are opened. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.osutils._walkdirs_utf8`` has been refactored into common
      tree walking, and modular directory listing code to aid future
      performance optimisations and refactoring. (Robert Collins)

    * ``bzrlib.trace.debug_memory`` can be used to get a quick memory dump
      in the middle of processing. It only reports memory if
      ``/proc/PID/status`` is available. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New method ``RevisionSpec.as_tree`` for representing the revision
      specifier as a revision tree object. (Luk=E1=9A Lalinsk=FD)

    * New race-free method on MutableTree ``get_file_with_stat`` for use
      when generating stat cache results. (Robert Collins)

    * New win32utils.get_local_appdata_location() provides access to a loca=
l
      directory for storing data.  (Mark Hammond)

    * To be compatible with python-2.6 a few new rules should be
      observed. 'message' attribute can't be used anymore in exception
      classes, 'sha' and 'md5' modules have been deprecated (use
      osutils.[md5|sha]), object__init__ and object.__new__ don't accept
      parameters anymore.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

bzr 1.8 2008-10-16
------------------

Bazaar 1.8 includes several fixes that improve working tree performance,
display of revision logs, and merges.  The bzr testsuite now passes on OS
X and Python 2.6, and almost completely passes on Windows.  The
smartserver code has gained several bug fixes and performance
improvements, and can now run server-side hooks within an http server.

  BUG FIXES:

   * Fix "Must end write group" error when another error occurs during
     ``bzr push``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #230902)

  PORTABILITY:

   * Some Pyrex versions require the WIN32 macro defined to compile on
     that platform.  (Alexander Belchenko, Martin Pool, #277481)


bzr 1.8rc1 2008-10-07
---------------------

  CHANGES:

    * ``bzr log file`` has been changed. It now uses a different method
      for determining which revisions to show as merging the changes to
      the file. It now only shows revisions which merged the change
      towards your mainline. This simplifies the output, makes it faster,
      and reduces memory consumption.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr merge`` now defaults to having ``--reprocess`` set, whenever
      ``--show-base`` is not supplied.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr+http//`` will now optionally load plugins and write logs on the
      server. (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzrlib._dirstate_helpers_c.pyx`` does not compile correctly with
      Pyrex 0.9.4.1 (it generates C code which causes segfaults). We
      explicitly blacklist that version of the compiler for that
      extension. Packaged versions will include .c files created with
      pyrex >=3D 0.9.6 so it doesn't effect releases, only users running
      from the source tree. (John Arbash Meinel, #276868)

  FEATURES

    * bzr is now compatible with python-2.6. python-2.6 is not yet official=
ly
      supported (nor released, tests were conducted with the dev version of
      python-2.6rc2), but all known problems have been fixed.  Feedback
      welcome.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #269535)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr annotate`` will now include uncommitted changes from the local
      working tree by default. Such uncommitted changes are given the
      revision number they would get if a commit was done, followed with a
      ? to indicate that its not actually known. (Robert Collins, #3439)

    * ``bzr branch`` now accepts a ``--standalone`` option, which creates a
      standalone branch regardless of the presence of shared repositories.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * ``bzr push`` is faster in the case there are no new revisions to
      push.  It is also faster if there are no tags in the local branch.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * File changes during a commit will update the tree stat cache.
      (Robert Collins)

    * Location aliases can now accept a trailing path.  (Micheal Hudson)

    * New hooks ``Lock.hooks`` when LockDirs are acquired and released.=20
      (Robert Collins, MartinPool)

    * Switching in heavyweight checkouts uses the master branch's context, =
not
      the checkout's context.  (Adrian Wilkins)

    * ``status`` on large trees is now faster, due to optimisations in the
      walkdirs code. Of particular note, the walkdirs code now performs
      a temporary ``chdir()`` while reading a single directory; if your
      platform has non thread-local current working directories (and is
      not windows which has its own implementation), this may introduce a
      race condition during concurrent uses of bzrlib. The bzrlib CLI
      will not encounter this as it is single threaded for working tree
      operations. (Robert Collins)

    * The C extensions now build on python 2.4 (Robert Collins, #271939)

    * The ``-Dhpss`` debug flag now reports the number of smart server
      calls per medium to stderr.  This is in addition to the existing
      detailed logging to the .bzr.log trace file.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Avoid random failures arising from misinterpreted ``errno`` values
      in ``_readdir_pyx.read_dir``.
      (Martin Pool, #279381)

    * Branching from a shared repository on a smart server into a new
      repository now preserves the repository format.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #269214)

    * ``bzr log`` now accepts a ``--change`` option.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #248427)

    * ``bzr missing`` now accepts an ``--include-merges`` option.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #233817)

    * Don't try to filter (internally) '.bzr' from the files to be deleted =
if
      it's not there.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #272648)

    * Fix '_in_buffer' AttributeError when using the -Dhpss debug flag.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Fix TooManyConcurrentRequests errors caused by a connection failure
      when doing ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from a ``bzr+ssh`` URL.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #246233)

    * Fixed ``bzr st -r branch:PATH_TO_BRANCH`` where the other branch
      is in a different repository than the current one.
      (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD, #144421)

    * Make the first line of the manpage preamble a comment again.
      (David Futcher, #242106)

    * Remove use of optional parameter in GSSAPI FTP support, since=20
      it breaks newer versions of Python-Kerberos. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * The autopacking logic will now always create a single new pack from
      all of the content which it deems is worth moving. This avoids the
      'repack a single pack' bug and should result in better packing
      overall.  (John Arbash Meinel, #242510, #172644)

    * Trivial documentation fix.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #270471)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Explain revision/range identifiers. (Daniel Clemente)

    * ``CommitBuilder.record_entry_contents`` returns one more element in
      its result tuple - an optional file system hash for the hash cache

Hi,

I'm happy to announce the availability of a candidate for the 1.9
release of Bazaar.

This release adds a new non-default format, 1.9 which uses B+Tree
indexes that are both smaller and faster to access.  1.9 is not the
default, so newly created repositories are readable by older versions
of Bazaar.  It also has some useful performance improvements to
network performance, particularly when pushing over ssh (or other
smartserver cases).

I'd like to ask our more advanced users to try out both of these areas
in particular, upgrading your repositories to 1.9 and giving
bzr+ssh:// a bit of a workout.  Please report any problems you find.

A source release is now available from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download>.  I'd ask package maintainers and
also plugin maintainers to update and upload as soon as they can so
that we can get wide testing.  The Windows installers have been in
flux in the last two releases but before 1.9final we should have both
python-based and standalone installers.

bzr 1.9 2008-10-31
------------------

This release of Bazaar adds a new repository format, ``1.9``, with smaller
and more efficient index files.  This format can be specified when
creating a new repository, or used to losslessly upgrade an existing
repository.  bzr 1.9 also speeds most operations over the smart server
protocol, makes annotate faster, and uses less memory when making
checkouts or pulling large amounts of data.


  NEW FEATURES:

    * New Branch hook ``transform_fallback_location`` allows a function to
      be called when looking up the stacked source. (Michael Hudson)

    * New repository formats ``1.9`` and ``1.9-rich-root``. These have all
      the functionality of ``1.6``, but use the new btree indexes.
      These indexes are both smaller and faster for access to historical
      information.  (John Arbash Meinel)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``BTreeIndex`` code now is able to prefetch extra pages to help tune
      the tradeoff between bandwidth and latency. Should be tuned
      appropriately to not impact commands which need minimal information,
      but provide a significant boost to ones that need more context. Only
      has a direct impact on the ``--development2`` format which uses
      btree's for the indexes. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr dump-btree`` is a hidden command introduced to allow dumping
      the contents of a compressed btree file.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr pack`` now tells the index builders to optimize for size. For
      btree index repositories, this can save 25% of the index size
      (mostly in the text indexes). (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr push`` to an existing branch or repository on a smart server
      is faster, due to Bazaar making more use of the ``get_parent_map``
      RPC when querying the remote branch's revision graph.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * default username for bzr+ssh and sftp can be configured in
      authentication.conf. (Aaron Bentley)

    * launchpad-login now provides a default username for bzr+ssh and sftp
      URLs, allowing username-free URLs to work for everyone. (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``lp:`` lookups no longer include usernames, making them shareable and
      shorter. (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``PackRepository.autopack`` smart server RPC, which does
      autopacking entirely on the server.  This is much faster than
      autopacking via plain file methods, which downloads a large amount
      of pack data and then re-uploads the same pack data into a single
      file.  This fixes a major (although infrequent) cause of lengthy
      delays when using a smart server.  For example, pushing the 10th
      revision to a repository with 9 packs now takes 44 RPCs rather than
      179, and much less bandwidth too.  This requires Bazaar 1.9 on both
      the client and the server, otherwise the client will fallback to the
      slower method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * A failure to load a plugin due to an IncompatibleAPI exception is
      now correctly reported. (Robert Collins, #279451)

    * API versioning support now has a multiple-version checking api
      ``require_any_api``. (Robert Collins, #279447)

    * ``bzr branch --stacked`` from a smart server to a standalone branch
      works again.  This fixes a regression in 1.7 and 1.8.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #270397)

    * ``bzr co`` uses less memory. It used to unpack the entire WT into
      memory before writing it to disk. This was a little bit faster, but
      consumed lots of memory. (John Arbash Meinel, #269456)

    * ``bzr missing --quiet`` no longer prints messages about whether
      there are missing revisions.  The exit code indicates whether there
      were or not.  (Martin Pool, #284748)

    * Fixes to the ``annotate`` code. The fast-path which re-used the
      stored deltas was accidentally disabled all the time, instead of
      only when a branch was stacked. Second, the code would accidentally
      re-use a delta even if it wasn't against the left-parent, this
      could only happen if ``bzr reconcile`` decided that the parent
      ordering was incorrect in the file graph.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * "Permission denied" errors that occur when pushing a new branch to a
      smart server no longer cause tracebacks.  (Andrew Bennetts, #278673)

    * Some compatibility fixes for building the extensions with MSVC and
      for python2.4. (John Arbash Meinel, #277484)

    * The index logic is now able to reload the list of pack files if and
      index ends up disappearing. We still don't reload if the pack data
      itself goes missing after checking the index. This bug appears as a
      transient failure (file not found) when another process is writing
      to the repository.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * ``bzr switch`` and ``bzr bind`` will now update the branch nickname if
      it was previously set. All checkouts will now refer to the bound branch
      for a nickname if one was not explicitly set.
      (Marius Kruger, #230903)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved hook documentation. (Michael Ernst)

  API CHANGES:

    * commands.plugins_cmds is now a CommandRegistry, not a dict.

  INTERNALS:

     * New AuthenticationConfig.set_credentials method allows easy programmatic
       configuration of authetication credentials.

I'm happy to announce the release of version 0.4.14 of
bzr-svn. It fixes some minor bugs as well as compatibility with bzr 1.9.

The list of changes since 0.4.13 is:

  BUG FIXES

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.9. (#279444)

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.9.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the $1.9.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- - Lazy command loading so bzrtools doesn't slow down Bazaar unnecessarily
- - Clean-tree now prompts before deleting files
- - "shelve" and "unshelve" are now aliases for "shelve1" and "unshelve1"
respectively, so that they can be cleanly replaced by shelf2 when it
enters Bazaar core.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.9.0 is available at:

http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.9.0/+download/bzrtools-1.9.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.9.0/+download/bzrtools-1.9.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce maintenance release QBzr 0.9.5.

https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.9.5

This release contains various bugfixes and bunch of small improvements.
It intended to use with bzr 1.6-1.9 (and maybe even with older version of bzr,
but it's not tested).

New features:

 * qcat:
   * New command-line option `--native` to show file content in native
     application rather than in usual QCat window. (experimental)
 * qtag: new command to edit tags.
 * New translation added: Turkish

List of resolved bugs could be found here:
https://launchpad.net/qbzr/+milestone/0.9.5

Download new code:
  Source tarball (platform independent):
    http://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.9.5/+download/qbzr-0.9.5.tar.gz

  Windows Python-based installer:
    http://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.9.5/+download/qbzr-0.9.5.win32.exe

NOTES:
when upgrading old installation (<0.9.2) of QBzr to 0.9.5,
please uninstall or remove old files first.

What is QBzr:
QBzr is a cross-platform GUI front end for Bazaar, based on Qt toolkit.
It provides GUI for many core bzr commands, like log, diff, commit, etc.
List of commands: qadd, qannotate, qbrowse, qcat, qcommit, qconfig,
qinfo, qinit, qdiff, qlog, qmerge, qpull/qpush, qrevert, qtag;
qgetnew, qgetupdates

We have finally created another all-in-one Windows installer, which is
now available to download from:
  https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.9/1.9rc1

We would appreciate people testing this installer (bzr-setup-1.9rc1.exe)
 as it is the first time we have built the installer on the new shared
host. This should make future releases much easier to build, as putting
together the setup for the all-in-one installer actually requires many
preparation steps. (Windows dependencies are not a simple 'apt-get' away.)

There has been one report that the installer starts to give errors until
the user reboots the machine. If possible, we would rather not require a
reboot. So if people could test, and report if a reboot was/wasn't
necessary, it would be very appreciated.

Thanks for your assistance,
John

Following the first round of feedback, I've created another all-in-one
installer, which should be uploading now. It is
"bzr-setup-1.9rc1-2.exe". In this installer, I should have fixed:

1) paramiko not being installed. (It turns out that setuptool's egg
files are not compatible with py2exe, so you have to use "easy_install
- -Z paramiko".)

2) libsvn_client-1.dll not being found. It seems that our current build
process does not find and copy these files into the installer. So I went
ahead and did it manually, but this is something we will need to fix in
a more permanent manner.

3) pyenchant is now also installed, which I believe adds spell-checking
to qbzr (such as qcommit).

4) Someone mentioned missing the option to install CA certificates. I
think this is because I'm not bundling pycurl in the 1.9 installer. So
it would be nice if people could try the new installer with https://
urls, just to make sure our https support still works as expected.

Thanks to those who gave feedback already on the installer (John Whitley
Eugene Wee, and Martin Pool specifically), and I look forward to the
next round.

Hi all,

I'm bemused to announce BzrTools 1.9.1

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.9.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- This restores runtime ignores for .shelf directories, which had been
  accidentally removed in 1.9.1
- More cleanup of unused stuff in command_classes.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.9.1 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.9.1/+download/bzrtools-1.9.1.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.9.1/+download/bzrtools-1.9.1.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

Now that we've had round 2, time for round 3. This one fixes:

1) For some reason the QtGui4.dll was incompletely copied before. My
best guess is a ^C at just the right time, and a build process that
didn't notice it was out of date.

2) Revamped build process. I now have a single script which wipes and
creates a new in-progress dir, downloads all of the plugins I need,
grabs the exact tag version, installs it all into the in-progress
directory, and builds the installer.

This should lead to more reliable builds in the future.

3) The exact 0.9.5 release of qbzr, and the new 1.9.1 release of bzrtools.

4) I've confirmed that qbzr commands load locally, and that 'bzr log
svn/branch' also works. (I also checked that 'bzr qlog svn/branch' shows
reasonable info.)

I also tested using paramiko as the transport, though for some reason
'svn+ssh' uses a different connection. (doing bzr log bzr+ssh doesn't
require my password, but doing "bzr log svn+ssh" does.)

Anyway, I'm fairly confident in this build, and I'd love for people to
give it a shot.

I'm happy to announce the release of bzr 1.9.

This release of Bazaar adds a new repository format, ``1.9``, with smaller
and more efficient index files.  This format can be specified when
creating a new repository, or used to losslessly upgrade an existing
repository.  bzr 1.9 also speeds most operations over the smart server
protocol, makes annotate faster, and uses less memory when making
checkouts or pulling large amounts of data.

Thanks to everyone who sent patches, bug reports, suggestions and
encouragement.

bzr 1.9 is now available from http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as
a source tarball; packages for various systems will be available soon.

Changes since the last release are listed below.

bzr 1.9 2008-11-07
------------------

This release of Bazaar adds a new repository format, ``1.9``, with smaller
and more efficient index files.  This format can be specified when
creating a new repository, or used to losslessly upgrade an existing
repository.  bzr 1.9 also speeds most operations over the smart server
protocol, makes annotate faster, and uses less memory when making
checkouts or pulling large amounts of data.

  BUG FIXES:

   * Fix "invalid property value 'branch-nick' for None" regression with
     branches bound to svn branches.  (Martin Pool, #293440)

   * Fix SSL/https on Python2.6.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #293054)

   * ``SFTPTransport.readv()`` had a bug when requests were out-of-order.
     This only triggers some-of-the-time on Knit format repositories.
     (John Arbash Meinel, #293746)


bzr 1.9rc1 2008-10-31
---------------------

  NEW FEATURES:

    * New Branch hook ``transform_fallback_location`` allows a function to
      be called when looking up the stacked source. (Michael Hudson)

    * New repository formats ``1.9`` and ``1.9-rich-root``. These have all
      the functionality of ``1.6``, but use the new btree indexes.
      These indexes are both smaller and faster for access to historical
      information.  (John Arbash Meinel)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``BTreeIndex`` code now is able to prefetch extra pages to help tune
      the tradeoff between bandwidth and latency. Should be tuned
      appropriately to not impact commands which need minimal information,
      but provide a significant boost to ones that need more context. Only
      has a direct impact on the ``--development2`` format which uses
      btree's for the indexes. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr dump-btree`` is a hidden command introduced to allow dumping
      the contents of a compressed btree file.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr pack`` now tells the index builders to optimize for size. For
      btree index repositories, this can save 25% of the index size
      (mostly in the text indexes). (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzr push`` to an existing branch or repository on a smart server
      is faster, due to Bazaar making more use of the ``get_parent_map``
      RPC when querying the remote branch's revision graph.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * default username for bzr+ssh and sftp can be configured in
      authentication.conf. (Aaron Bentley)

    * launchpad-login now provides a default username for bzr+ssh and sftp
      URLs, allowing username-free URLs to work for everyone. (Aaron Bentle=
y)

    * ``lp:`` lookups no longer include usernames, making them shareable and
      shorter. (Aaron Bentley)

    * New ``PackRepository.autopack`` smart server RPC, which does
      autopacking entirely on the server.  This is much faster than
      autopacking via plain file methods, which downloads a large amount
      of pack data and then re-uploads the same pack data into a single
      file.  This fixes a major (although infrequent) cause of lengthy
      delays when using a smart server.  For example, pushing the 10th
      revision to a repository with 9 packs now takes 44 RPCs rather than
      179, and much less bandwidth too.  This requires Bazaar 1.9 on both
      the client and the server, otherwise the client will fallback to the
      slower method.  (Andrew Bennetts)

  BUG FIXES:

    * A failure to load a plugin due to an IncompatibleAPI exception is
      now correctly reported. (Robert Collins, #279451)

    * API versioning support now has a multiple-version checking api
      ``require_any_api``. (Robert Collins, #279447)

    * ``bzr branch --stacked`` from a smart server to a standalone branch=
=20
      works again.  This fixes a regression in 1.7 and 1.8.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #270397)

    * ``bzr co`` uses less memory. It used to unpack the entire WT into
      memory before writing it to disk. This was a little bit faster, but
      consumed lots of memory. (John Arbash Meinel, #269456)

    * ``bzr missing --quiet`` no longer prints messages about whether
      there are missing revisions.  The exit code indicates whether there
      were or not.  (Martin Pool, #284748)

    * Fixes to the ``annotate`` code. The fast-path which re-used the
      stored deltas was accidentally disabled all the time, instead of
      only when a branch was stacked. Second, the code would accidentally
      re-use a delta even if it wasn't against the left-parent, this
      could only happen if ``bzr reconcile`` decided that the parent
      ordering was incorrect in the file graph.  (John Arbash Meinel)

    * "Permission denied" errors that occur when pushing a new branch to a
      smart server no longer cause tracebacks.  (Andrew Bennetts, #278673)

    * Some compatibility fixes for building the extensions with MSVC and
      for python2.4. (John Arbash Meinel, #277484)

    * The index logic is now able to reload the list of pack files if and
      index ends up disappearing. We still don't reload if the pack data
      itself goes missing after checking the index. This bug appears as a
      transient failure (file not found) when another process is writing
      to the repository.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * ``bzr switch`` and ``bzr bind`` will now update the branch nickname if
      it was previously set. All checkouts will now refer to the bound bran=
ch
      for a nickname if one was not explicitly set.
      (Marius Kruger, #230903)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved hook documentation. (Michael Ernst)

  API CHANGES:

    * commands.plugins_cmds is now a CommandRegistry, not a dict.

  INTERNALS:

I'm happy to announce the release of bzr-svn 0.4.15, which is a bug
fix release fixing some errors in the way bzr-svn would set custom
file properties in Subversion, and also making it a bit more robust
against 3rd-party modification of bzr-svn file properties (such as
people removing the file properties entirely or just a single line,
e.g. as part of running "svn revert").

The list of changes since 0.4.14 is:

  BUG FIXES

   * Ignore tags that happen to be files (another instance). (#290664)

   * Support copying from files with spaces in their names over http. (#268304)

   * Fix knit corruption because text revisions weren't stored properly. (#277043)

   * Cope with file properties being modified by other parties than 
     bzr-svn. (#295284)

   * Fix erroneous call to object.__init__() causing issues with Python2.6.

   * Don't take over when pulling from WebDAV source (without Subversion)
     (#274840)

The tarball can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.15.tar.gz

A GPG signature, made with my key, can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.15.tar.gz.asc

Please file bugs in Launchpad:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+filebug

Cheers,

Jelmer

Hi,

I'm happy to announce availability of bzr 1.10rc1, and to ask for your
help in testing it.  Our goal is to make a final release of 1.10 later
this week.

Source is available now from <https://launchpad.net/bzr/1.10/1.10rc1>
and Ubuntu and other packages should be available soon.

The full changelog is below.  It makes sense to concentrate testing on
the things most changed in this release: shelve and unshelve,
fetching, and bzr+ssh operations.  If you find problems, please let us
know by filing a bug, or on irc or the list.

Martin



bzr 1.10rc1 2008-11-28
----------------------

This release of Bazaar focusses on performance improvements when pushing
and pulling revisions, both locally and to remote networks.  The popular
``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` commands, used to interactively revert and
restore work in progress, have been merged from bzrtools into the bzr
core.  There are also bug fixes for portability, and for stacked branches.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * New ``commit_message_template`` hook that is called by the commit
      code to generate a template commit message. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * New `shelve` and `unshelve` commands allow undoing and redoing changes.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``(Remote)Branch.copy_content_into`` no longer generates the full revision
      history just to set the last revision info.
      (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Fetches between formats with different serializers (such as
      pack-0.92-subtree and 1.9-rich-root) are faster now.  This is due to
      operating on batches of 100 revisions at time rather than
      one-by-one.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Search index files corresponding to pack files we've already used
      before searching others, because they are more likely to have the
      keys we're looking for.  This reduces the number of iix and tix
      files accessed when pushing 1 new revision, for instance.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Signatures to transfer are calculated more efficiently in
      ``item_keys_introduced_by``.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * The generic fetch code can once again copy revisions and signatures
      without extracting them completely to fulltexts and then serializing
      them back down into byte strings. This is a significant performance
      improvement when fetching from a stacked branch.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #300289)

    * When making a large readv() request over ``bzr+ssh``, break up the
      request into more manageable chunks. Because the RPC is not yet able
      to stream, this helps keep us from buffering too much information at
      once. (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Better message when the user needs to set their Launchpad ID.
      (Martin Pool, #289148)

    * ``bzr commit --local`` doesn't access the master branch anymore.
      This fixes a regression introduced in 1.9.  (Marius Kruger, #299313)

    * Don't call the system ``chdir()`` with an empty path. Sun OS seems
      to give an error in that case.  Also, don't count on ``getcwd()``
      being able to allocate a new buffer, which is a gnu extension.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, Harry Hirsch, #297831)

    * Don't crash when requesting log --forward <file> for a revision range
      starting with a dotted revno.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #300055)

    * Don't create text deltas spanning stacked repositories; this could
      cause "Revision X not present in Y" when later accessing them.
      (Martin Pool, #288751)

    * Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
      the current operation if another action causes the data to be
      repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * PermissionDenied errors from smart servers no longer cause
      "PermissionDenied: "None"" on the client.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #299254)

    * Pushing to a stacked pack repository now batches writes, the same
      way writes are batched to ordinary pack repository.  This makes
      pushing to a stacked branch over the network much faster.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #294479)

    * TooManyConcurrentRequests no longer occur when a fetch fails and
      tries to abort a write group.  This allows the root cause (e.g. a
      network interruption) to be reported.  (Andrew Bennetts, #297014)

    * RemoteRepository.get_parent_map now uses fallback repositories.
      (Aaron Bentley, #297991?, #293679?)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``CommitBuilder`` now validates the strings it will be committing,
      to ensure that they do not have characters that will not be properly
      round-tripped. For now, it just checks for characters that are
      invalid in the XML form. (John Arbash Meinel, #295161)

    * Constructor parameters for NewPack (internal to pack repositories)
      have changed incompatibly.

    * ``Repository.abort_write_group`` now accepts an optional
      ``suppress_errors`` flag.  Repository implementations that override
      ``abort_write_group`` will need to be updated to accept the new
      argument.  Subclasses that only override ``_abort_write_group``
      don't need to change.

    * Transport implementations must provide copy_tree_to_transport.  A default
      implementation is provided for Transport subclasses.

  TESTING:

    * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if no doctests are found in a module
      that's expected to have them.  (Martin Pool)

    * Doctests now only report the first failure.  (Martin Pool)

Thanks! $VERSION is so much more awesome than $VERSION-1 ! ;-)

Something went wrong in your automated release sending script ? :-)

Nope, something went wrong between my left ear and my right ear.

I'm happy to announce the release of bzr-svn 0.4.16, which is another bug
fix release. This is most likely the last release in the 0.4 release
series; I hope to announce the first beta of 0.5.0 in the next couple
of days.

The list of changes since 0.4.15 is:

  BUG FIXES

   * Don't print backtrace when error occurs while accessing repository root.
     (#296224)

   * Add --svn-override-revprops option to svn-push.

   * Give proper error when tags can't be pushed. (#299490)

   * Set bzr:user-agent revision property, e.g. to allow blacklisting 
     in the future.

   * Fix removing of file properties. (#304866)

   * Allow target URLs in redirect requests to contain relative URLs. (#303959)

   * Fix compatibility with bzr 1.10.

The tarball can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.4.16.tar.gz

A GPG signature, made with my key, can be found at:

Hi!

I've just uploaded bzr-pida first version.

It has a very basic set of stuff working, but I'm working hard to complete
it.

The official release with a download link is here:
https://launchpad.net/bzr-pida/+announcement/1537

Also, I'm maintaining a blog (which is also in the planet) to keep track of
the work I'm doing in this.

Thanks Canonical for the Support!

NEWS since the previous release:

bzr 1.10 2008-12-05
- -------------------

Bazaar 1.10 has several performance improvements for copying revisions
(especially for small updates to large projects).  There has also been a
significant amount of effort in polishing stacked branches.  The commands
``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` have become core commands, with an improved
implementation.

The only changes versus bzr-1.10rc1 are bugfixes for stacked branches.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Don't set a pack write cache size from RepoFetcher, because the
      cache is not coherent with reads and causes ShortReadvErrors.
      This reverses the change that fixed #294479.
      (Martin Pool, #303856)

    * Properly handle when a revision can be inserted as a delta versus
      when it needs to be expanded to a fulltext for stacked branches.
      There was a bug involving merge revisions. As a method to help
      prevent future difficulties, also make stacked fetches sort
      topologically. (John Arbash Meinel, #304841)


bzr 1.10rc1 2008-11-28
- ----------------------

This release of Bazaar focuses on performance improvements when pushing
and pulling revisions, both locally and to remote networks.  The popular
``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` commands, used to interactively revert and
restore work in progress, have been merged from bzrtools into the bzr
core.  There are also bug fixes for portability, and for stacked branches.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * New ``commit_message_template`` hook that is called by the commit
      code to generate a template commit message. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * New `shelve` and `unshelve` commands allow undoing and redoing changes.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``(Remote)Branch.copy_content_into`` no longer generates the full
      revision history just to set the last revision info.
      (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Fetches between formats with different serializers (such as
      pack-0.92-subtree and 1.9-rich-root) are faster now.  This is due to
      operating on batches of 100 revisions at time rather than
      one-by-one.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * Search index files corresponding to pack files we've already used
      before searching others, because they are more likely to have the
      keys we're looking for.  This reduces the number of iix and tix
      files accessed when pushing 1 new revision, for instance.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Signatures to transfer are calculated more efficiently in
      ``item_keys_introduced_by``.  (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel)

    * The generic fetch code can once again copy revisions and signatures
      without extracting them completely to fulltexts and then serializing
      them back down into byte strings. This is a significant performance
      improvement when fetching from a stacked branch.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #300289)

    * When making a large readv() request over ``bzr+ssh``, break up the
      request into more manageable chunks. Because the RPC is not yet able
      to stream, this helps keep us from buffering too much information at
      once. (John Arbash Meinel)

  BUG FIXES:

    * Better message when the user needs to set their Launchpad ID.
      (Martin Pool, #289148)

    * ``bzr commit --local`` doesn't access the master branch anymore.
      This fixes a regression introduced in 1.9.  (Marius Kruger, #299313)

    * Don't call the system ``chdir()`` with an empty path. Sun OS seems
      to give an error in that case.  Also, don't count on ``getcwd()``
      being able to allocate a new buffer, which is a gnu extension.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Martin Pool, Harry Hirsch, #297831)

    * Don't crash when requesting log --forward <file> for a revision range
      starting with a dotted revno.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #300055)

    * Don't create text deltas spanning stacked repositories; this could
      cause "Revision X not present in Y" when later accessing them.
      (Martin Pool, #288751)

    * Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
      the current operation if another action causes the data to be
      repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * PermissionDenied errors from smart servers no longer cause
      "PermissionDenied: "None"" on the client.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #299254)

    * Pushing to a stacked pack repository now batches writes, the same
      way writes are batched to ordinary pack repository.  This makes
      pushing to a stacked branch over the network much faster.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #294479)

    * TooManyConcurrentRequests no longer occur when a fetch fails and
      tries to abort a write group.  This allows the root cause (e.g. a
      network interruption) to be reported.  (Andrew Bennetts, #297014)

    * RemoteRepository.get_parent_map now uses fallback repositories.
      (Aaron Bentley, #297991?, #293679?)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``CommitBuilder`` now validates the strings it will be committing,
      to ensure that they do not have characters that will not be properly
      round-tripped. For now, it just checks for characters that are
      invalid in the XML form. (John Arbash Meinel, #295161)

    * Constructor parameters for NewPack (internal to pack repositories)
      have changed incompatibly.

    * ``Repository.abort_write_group`` now accepts an optional
      ``suppress_errors`` flag.  Repository implementations that override
      ``abort_write_group`` will need to be updated to accept the new
      argument.  Subclasses that only override ``_abort_write_group``
      don't need to change.

    * Transport implementations must provide copy_tree_to_transport.  A
      default implementation is provided for Transport subclasses.

  TESTING:

    * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if no doctests are found in a module
      that's expected to have them.  (Martin Pool)

    * Doctests now only report the first failure.  (Martin Pool)

X-List-Received-Date: Mon, 08 Dec 2008 03:25:50 -0000

I'm happy to announce the availability of the very first release
candidate of bzr-svn 0.5.0. This release make some significant
improvements to the overall design of bzr-svn, resulting in significant
improvements in performance, the removal of "branching schemes" and the
ability to store bzr metadata in Subversion revision properties rather
than file properties.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE FINAL RELEASE. It may eat your cat or
corrupt your Bazaar repositories (although I haven't seen either happen
yet). Please make sure you backup if you use this rc against
production data.

New mapping format
==================

bzr-svn 0.5 introduces a new version of the mapping used by bzr-svn. This has
several advantages, such as making bzr-svn more flexible in what paths 
are considered branches and being able to work without bzr-specific file 
properties in a Subversion >= 1.5 repository when pushing/committing to that 
repository from bzr.

Disadvantage of this new mapping format is that older bzr-svn clients won't 
be able to recognize any bzr metadata on new revisions pushed using bzr-svn 0.5.

It is possible to make bzr-svn use the old-style mappings when pushing 
revisions by setting "default-mapping = v3" in ~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf or 
~/.bazaar/subversion.conf, for example if you still use older versions of 
bzr-svn that you can't upgrade.

Changes since 0.4.16
====================

The list of changes since 0.4.16 is:

  CHANGES

   * Implement set-revprops command.

   * Introduces a new Bzr<->Svn mapping format. Please 
     read UPGRADING for details.
	 
	 + Uses revision properties where possible. (#127736)

     + Branching schemes are no longer used and are 
	   replaced by "repository layouts", which are 
	   much more flexible. (#130372)

   * Will avoid browsing the full repository for bzr-revisions, 
     only closely related paths. (#158657)

  FEATURES

   * Performance has been improved *significantly*.

   * Add bzr:skip revision property to allow skipping 
     more detailed analysis of revisions not created by bzr.

   * "bzr revert" in a Subversion working tree now works.

   * Create branches/ directory automatically if it didn't exist
     when pushing merged revisions.

   * Only fetch signatures if they can be cheaply copied.

   * Also upgrade fileids in workingtree during svn-upgrade.

   * Add --until option to svn-import.

   * Add experimental svn-serve subcommand.

  BUG FIXES

   * Set bzr signature revision property during commit if possible.

   * Provide SvnWorkingTree._transport. (#264548)

   * Don't rely on cache when checking revision id during commit. (#230863)

   * Avoid pushing changes again when pushing new branch. (#203368)

   * Store text parents properly. (#260416)

   * Avoid leaking memory when attempting to open an invalid Subversion 
     repository. (#262513)

   * Fix corner case corruption pulling from a svn repository that contains bzr-roundtripped 
     revisions. (#260416)

   * Upgrade tags as well during svn-upgrade.

   * Correctly detect prefix when repository root is URL root (#303292)

   * Fix removing file properties. (#304866)

   * Fix canonicalization of paths to svn_ra_diff(). (#304894)

  INTERNALS

   * Remove custom commit code for working tree. 

    + Standard commit code provides commit notification. (#79333)

Known issues
============

- Commit in native subversion working copies doesn't update the working
copy after the commit properly yet. This will be fixed in the next
release candidate or final release.

- The internal bzr-svn cache is actually slower for large repositories.
It is recommended to disable the cache for these repositories by
setting "use-cache = False" in ~/.bazaar/subversion.conf for the
relevant repositories. In the future, the cache will be made smarter or
bzr-svn will disable it automagically in some situations.

Downloading
===========

The tarball can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.5.0~rc1.tar.gz

A GPG signature, made with my key, can be found at:

http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.5.0~rc1.gz.asc

I have also uploaded a package to Debian experimental.

Bugs
====

Please file bugs in Launchpad:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr-svn/+filebug

I'm interested in hearing about any bug you find, in particular about
any sort of regressions since 0.4.

Cheers,

Jelmer

This first monthly release of Bazaar for 2009 improves Bazaar's
operation in Windows, Mac OS X, and other situations where file names
are matched without regard to capitalization: Bazaar tries to match the
case of an existing file. This release of Bazaar also improves the
efficiency of Tortoise Windows Shell integration and lets it work on
64-bit platforms.

The UI through which Bazaar supports historic formats has been improved,
so 'bzr help formats' now gives a simpler and shorter list, with clear
advice.

This release also fixes a number of bugs, particularly a glitch that can
occur when there are concurrent writes to a pack repository.

We'd particularly appreciate testing of the case-insensitivity features.

Thanks to the many people who contributed patches, suggestions, bug
reports and encouragement!

Source is now available from <http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download>; packages=20
for Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X will follow soon.  The full changelog
is below.

bzr 1.11rc1 "Eyes up!" 2009-01-09
---------------------------------

This first monthly release of Bazaar for 2009 improves Bazaar's operation
in Windows, Mac OS X, and other situations where file names are matched
without regard to capitalization: Bazaar tries to match the case of an
existing file.  This release of Bazaar also improves the efficiency of
Tortoise Windows Shell integration and lets it work on 64-bit platforms.

The UI through which Bazaar supports historic formats has been improved,
so 'bzr help formats' now gives a simpler and shorter list, with clear
advice.

This release also fixes a number of bugs, particularly a glitch that can
occur when there are concurrent writes to a pack repository.

  CHANGES:

    * Formats using Knit-based repository formats are now explicitly
      marked as deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Add support for `bzr tags -r 1..2`, that is we now support showing
      tags applicable for a specified revision range. (Marius Kruger)

    * ``authentication.conf`` now accepts pluggable read-only credential
      stores. Such a plugin (``netrc_credential_store``) is now included,
      handles the ``$HOME/.netrc`` file and can server as an example to
      implement other plugins.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``shelve --list`` can now be used to list shelved changes.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Add trailing slash to directories in all output of ``bzr ls``, except
      ``bzr ls --null``. (Gordon P. Hemsley, #306424)

    * ``bzr revision-info`` now supports a -d option to specify an
      alternative branch. (Michael Hudson)

    * Add connection to a C++ implementation of the Windows Shell Extension
      which is able to fully replace the current Python implemented one.
      Advantages include 64bit support and reduction in overhead for
      processes which drag in shell extensions.
      (Mark Hammond)

    * Support the Claws mail client directly, rather than via
      xdg-email. This prevents the display of an unnecessary modal
      dialog in Claws, informing the user that a file has been
      attached to the message, and works around bug #291847 in
      xdg-utils which corrupts the destination address.

    * When working on a case-insensitive case-preserving file-system, as
      commonly found with Windows, bzr will often ignore the case of the
      arguments specified by the user in preference to the case of an exist=
ing
      item on the file-system or in the inventory to help prevent
      counter-intuitive behaviour on Windows. (Mark Hammond)

  BUG FIXES:
 =20
    * Fix a problem with CIFS client/server lag on Windows colliding with
      an invariant-per-process algorithm for generating AtomicFile names
      (Adrian Wilkins, #304023)

    * Allow BzrDir implementation to implement backing up of=20
      control directory. (#139691)

    * Don't call iteritems on transport_list_registry, because it may
      change during iteration.  (Martin Pool, #277048)

    * Don't make a broken branch when pushing an unstackable-format branch
      that's in a stackable shared repository to a location with default
      stack-on location.  (Andrew Bennetts, #291046)

    * Don't require embedding user in HTTP(S) URLs do use authentication.co=
nf.
      (Ben Jansen, Vincent Ladeuil, #300347)

    * Fix bogus setUp signature in UnavailableFTPServer.
      (Gary van der Merwe, #313498)

    * Fix compilation error in ``_dirstate_helpers_c`` on SunOS/Solaris.
      (Jari Aalto)

    * Fix SystemError in ``_patiencediff_c`` module by calling
      PyErr_NoMemory() before returning NULL in PatienceSequenceMatcher_new.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #303206)

    * Give proper error message for diff with non-existent dotted revno.
      (Marius Kruger, #301969)

    * Handle EACCES (permission denied) errors when launching a message
      editor, and emit warnings when a configured editor cannot be
      started. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``$HOME/.netrc`` file is now recognized as a read-only credential sto=
re
      if configured in ``authentication.conf`` with 'password_encoding=3Dne=
trc'
      in the appropriate sections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #103029)

    * Preserve transport decorators while following redirections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #245964, #270863)

    * Provides a finer and more robust filter for accepted redirections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #303959, #265070)

    * ``shelve`` paths are now interpreted relative to the current working
      tree.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``Transport.readv()`` defaults to not reading more than 100MB in a
      single array. Further ``RemoteTransport.readv`` sets this to 5MB to
      work better with how it splits its requests.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #303538)

    * Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
      the current operation if another action causes the data to be
      repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * ``pull -v`` now respects the log_format configuration variable.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``push -v`` now works on non-initial pushes.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Use the short status format when the short format is used for log.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87179)

    * Allow files to be renamed or moved via remove + add-by-id. (Charles
      Duffy, #314251)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved the formats help topic to explain why multiple formats
      exist and to provide guidelines in selecting one. Introduced
      two new supporting help topics: current-formats and other-formats.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``LRUCache(after_cleanup_size)`` was renamed to
      ``after_cleanup_count`` and the old name deprecated. The new name is
      used for clarity, and to avoid confusion with
      ``LRUSizeCache(after_cleanup_size)``. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New ``ForeignRepository`` base class, to help with foreign branch=20
      support (e.g. svn).  (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * ``node_distances`` and ``select_farthest`` can no longer be imported
      from ``bzrlib.graph``.  They can still be imported from
      ``bzrlib.deprecated_graph``, which has been the preferred way to
      import them since before 1.0.  (Andrew Bennetts)
     =20
    * The logic in commit now delegates inventory basis calculations to
      the ``CommitBuilder`` object; this requires that the commit builder
      in use has been updated to support the new ``recording_deletes`` and
      ``record_delete`` methods. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * An HTTPS server is now available (it requires python-2.6). Future bzr
      versions will allow the use of the python-2.6 ssl module that can be
      installed for 2.5 and 2.4.

    * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if new trailing white space is added to
      the bazaar sources. It only checks changes not committed yet. This
      means that PQM will now reject changes that introduce new trailing
      whitespace. (Marius Kruger)

    * Introduced new experimental formats called ``1.12-preview`` and
      ``1.12-preview-rich-root`` to enable testing of related pending
      features, namely content filtering and filtered views.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added an ``InventoryEntry`` cache when deserializing inventories.
      Can cut the time to iterate over multiple RevisionsTrees in half.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Added ``bzrlib.fifo_cache.FIFOCache`` which is designed to have
      minimal overhead versus using a plain dict for cache hits, at the
      cost of not preserving the 'active' set as well as an ``LRUCache``.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.patience_diff.unified_diff`` now properly uses a tab
      character to separate the filename from the date stamp, and doesn't
      add trailing whitespace when a date stamp is not supplied.
      (Adeodato Sim=F3, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``DirStateWorkingTree`` and ``DirStateWorkingTreeFormat`` added
      as base classes of ``WorkingTree4`` and ``WorkingTreeFormat4``
      respectively. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``KnitVersionedFiles._check_should_delta()`` now uses the
      ``get_build_details`` api to avoid multiple hits to the index, and
      to properly follow the ``compression_parent`` rather than assuming
      it is the left-hand parent. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``KnitVersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` will now chose a
      more optimal ordering when the keys are requested 'unordered'.
      Previously the order was fully random, now the records should be
      returned from each pack in turn, in forward I/O order.
      (John Arbash Meinel)
   =20
    * ``mutter()`` will now flush the ``~/.bzr.log`` if it has been more
      than 2s since the last time it flushed. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.add_inventory_by_delta``
      allows adding an inventory via an inventory delta, which can be
      more efficient for some repository types. (Robert Collins)

    * Repository ``CommitBuilder`` objects can now accumulate an inventory
      delta. To enable this functionality call ``builder.recording_deletes``
      and additionally call ``builder.record_delete`` when a delete
      against the basis occurs. (Robert Collins)

    * The default http handler has been changed from pycurl to urllib.
      The default is still pycurl for https connections. (The only
      advantage of pycurl is that it checks ssl certificates.)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``VersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` can now return objects with a
      storage_kind of ``chunked``. This is a collection (list/tuple) of
      strings. You can use ``osutils.chunks_to_lines()`` to turn them into
      guaranteed 'lines' or you can use ``''.join(chunks)`` to turn it
      into a fulltext. This allows for some very good memory savings when
      asking for many texts that share ancestry, as the individual chunks
      can be shared between versions of the file. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``pull -v`` and ``push -v`` use new function
      ``bzrlib.log.show_branch_change`` (Aaron Bentley)

On behalf of QBzr developers I'd like to announce new 0.9.6 release.

https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.9.6

Changes in this release:

0.9.6 - 2009-01-10
----------------------
New features in this release: throbber, interactive password prompt,
post_uncommit hook, new bug-url command. Dozen of bugs fixed as well.

 * Add post_uncommit hook to remember the uncomitted commit message.
 * Add interactive prompt for password if access to the branch require it.
 * Add throbber feature: user will see message "Loading..." and animation
   when there is long operation in progress to indicate that qbzr window
   is not hang.
 * Command-line interface to QBzr commands now is much closer to
   coresponding commands in bzr itself. Where possible commands
   options are reused from bzr. (#272359)
 * qcommit:
   * Commit without message is forbidden (#297606).
   * If no files selected to commit then user will be asked
     for confirmation. Commit without files allowed only
     when bzr >= 1.6 is used. (#148165)
 * qdiff:
   * To detect binary files entire file content is analyzed, not only first 1K.
   * Short option name for --deleted changed from -D to -K.
   * If there is no changes in the tree or specified file list (file group)
     then show info box with "No changes found" message (#295767).
   * Unidiff produce valid headers. (#308095)
 * qlog: multiple improvements for showing common log of multiple branches.
 * qpull and qmerge in lightweight checkouts now working for the tree,
   not for the master branch. (#310314)
 * New command bug-url (console only) can show you full URL to bug number
   and optionally open this URL in your browser.
 * New translations added: Hebrew, Polish.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.11.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.11.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
shelf command is renamed to shelf1, to associate it with Shelf 1,
instead of the default shelf2 commands (which are named "shelve", rather
than "shelve1", etc).

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.11.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.11.0/+download/bzrtools-1.11.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.11.0/+download/bzrtools-1.11.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

-- 
Martin
on behalf of the Bazaar developers


bzr 1.11 "Eyes up!" 2009-01-19
------------------------------

This first monthly release of Bazaar for 2009 improves Bazaar's operation
in Windows, Mac OS X, and other situations where file names are matched
without regard to capitalization: Bazaar tries to match the case of an
existing file.  This release of Bazaar also improves the efficiency of
Tortoise Windows Shell integration and lets it work on 64-bit platforms.

The UI through which Bazaar supports historic formats has been improved,
so 'bzr help formats' now gives a simpler and shorter list, with clear
advice.

This release also fixes a number of bugs, particularly a glitch that can
occur when there are concurrent writes to a pack repository.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Fix failing test when CompiledChunksToLines is not available.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Stacked branches don't repeatedly open their transport connection.
      (John Arbash Meinel)



bzr 1.11rc1 "Eyes up!" 2009-01-09
---------------------------------

  CHANGES:

    * Formats using Knit-based repository formats are now explicitly
      marked as deprecated. (Ian Clatworthy)

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Add support for `bzr tags -r 1..2`, that is we now support showing
      tags applicable for a specified revision range. (Marius Kruger)

    * ``authentication.conf`` now accepts pluggable read-only credential
      stores. Such a plugin (``netrc_credential_store``) is now included,
      handles the ``$HOME/.netrc`` file and can server as an example to
      implement other plugins.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * ``shelve --list`` can now be used to list shelved changes.
      (Aaron Bentley)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Add trailing slash to directories in all output of ``bzr ls``, except
      ``bzr ls --null``. (Gordon P. Hemsley, #306424)

    * ``bzr revision-info`` now supports a -d option to specify an
      alternative branch. (Michael Hudson)

    * Add connection to a C++ implementation of the Windows Shell Extension
      which is able to fully replace the current Python implemented one.
      Advantages include 64bit support and reduction in overhead for
      processes which drag in shell extensions.
      (Mark Hammond)

    * Support the Claws mail client directly, rather than via
      xdg-email. This prevents the display of an unnecessary modal
      dialog in Claws, informing the user that a file has been
      attached to the message, and works around bug #291847 in
      xdg-utils which corrupts the destination address.

    * When working on a case-insensitive case-preserving file-system, as
      commonly found with Windows, bzr will often ignore the case of the
      arguments specified by the user in preference to the case of an existing
      item on the file-system or in the inventory to help prevent
      counter-intuitive behaviour on Windows. (Mark Hammond)

  BUG FIXES:
  
    * Allow BzrDir implementation to implement backing up of 
      control directory. (#139691)

    * ``bzr push`` creating a new stacked branch will now only open a
      single connection to the target machine. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Don't call iteritems on transport_list_registry, because it may
      change during iteration.  (Martin Pool, #277048)

    * Don't make a broken branch when pushing an unstackable-format branch
      that's in a stackable shared repository to a location with default
      stack-on location.  (Andrew Bennetts, #291046)

    * Don't require embedding user in HTTP(S) URLs do use authentication.conf.
      (Ben Jansen, Vincent Ladeuil, #300347)

    * Fix a problem with CIFS client/server lag on windows colliding with
      an invariant-per-process algorithm for generating AtomicFile names
      (Adrian Wilkins, #304023)

    * Fix bogus setUp signature in UnavailableFTPServer.
      (Gary van der Merwe, #313498)

    * Fix compilation error in ``_dirstate_helpers_c`` on SunOS/Solaris.
      (Jari Aalto)

    * Fix SystemError in ``_patiencediff_c`` module by calling
      PyErr_NoMemory() before returning NULL in PatienceSequenceMatcher_new.
      (Andrew Bennetts, #303206)

    * Give proper error message for diff with non-existent dotted revno.
      (Marius Kruger, #301969)

    * Handle EACCES (permission denied) errors when launching a message
      editor, and emit warnings when a configured editor cannot be
      started. (Andrew Bennetts)

    * ``$HOME/.netrc`` file is now recognized as a read-only credential store
      if configured in ``authentication.conf`` with 'password_encoding=netrc'
      in the appropriate sections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #103029)

    * Opening a stacked branch now properly shares the connection, rather
      than opening a new connection for the stacked-on branch.
      (John Arbash meinel)

    * Preserve transport decorators while following redirections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #245964, #270863)

    * Provides a finer and more robust filter for accepted redirections.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #303959, #265070)

    * ``shelve`` paths are now interpreted relative to the current working
      tree.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``Transport.readv()`` defaults to not reading more than 100MB in a
      single array. Further ``RemoteTransport.readv`` sets this to 5MB to
      work better with how it splits its requests.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #303538)

    * Pack repositories are now able to reload the pack listing and retry
      the current operation if another action causes the data to be
      repacked.  (John Arbash Meinel, #153786)

    * ``pull -v`` now respects the log_format configuration variable.
      (Aaron Bentley)

    * ``push -v`` now works on non-initial pushes.  (Aaron Bentley)

    * Use the short status format when the short format is used for log.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, #87179)

    * Allow files to be renamed or moved via remove + add-by-id. (Charles
      Duffy, #314251)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved the formats help topic to explain why multiple formats
      exist and to provide guidelines in selecting one. Introduced
      two new supporting help topics: current-formats and other-formats.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``LRUCache(after_cleanup_size)`` was renamed to
      ``after_cleanup_count`` and the old name deprecated. The new name is
      used for clarity, and to avoid confusion with
      ``LRUSizeCache(after_cleanup_size)``. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New ``ForeignRepository`` base class, to help with foreign branch 
      support (e.g. svn).  (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * ``node_distances`` and ``select_farthest`` can no longer be imported
      from ``bzrlib.graph``.  They can still be imported from
      ``bzrlib.deprecated_graph``, which has been the preferred way to
      import them since before 1.0.  (Andrew Bennetts)
      
    * The logic in commit now delegates inventory basis calculations to
      the ``CommitBuilder`` object; this requires that the commit builder
      in use has been updated to support the new ``recording_deletes`` and
      ``record_delete`` methods. (Robert Collins)

  TESTING:

    * An HTTPS server is now available (it requires python-2.6). Future bzr
      versions will allow the use of the python-2.6 ssl module that can be
      installed for 2.5 and 2.4.

    * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if new trailing white space is added to
      the bazaar sources. It only checks changes not committed yet. This
      means that PQM will now reject changes that introduce new trailing
      whitespace. (Marius Kruger)

    * Introduced new experimental formats called ``1.12-preview`` and
      ``1.12-preview-rich-root`` to enable testing of related pending
      features, namely content filtering and filtered views.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  INTERNALS:

    * Added an ``InventoryEntry`` cache when deserializing inventories.
      Can cut the time to iterate over multiple RevisionsTrees in half.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * Added ``bzrlib.fifo_cache.FIFOCache`` which is designed to have
      minimal overhead versus using a plain dict for cache hits, at the
      cost of not preserving the 'active' set as well as an ``LRUCache``.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``bzrlib.patience_diff.unified_diff`` now properly uses a tab
      character to separate the filename from the date stamp, and doesn't
      add trailing whitespace when a date stamp is not supplied.
      (Adeodato Sim, John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``DirStateWorkingTree`` and ``DirStateWorkingTreeFormat`` added
      as base classes of ``WorkingTree4`` and ``WorkingTreeFormat4``
      respectively. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``KnitVersionedFiles._check_should_delta()`` now uses the
      ``get_build_details`` api to avoid multiple hits to the index, and
      to properly follow the ``compression_parent`` rather than assuming
      it is the left-hand parent. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``KnitVersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` will now chose a
      more optimal ordering when the keys are requested 'unordered'.
      Previously the order was fully random, now the records should be
      returned from each pack in turn, in forward I/O order.
      (John Arbash Meinel)
    
    * ``mutter()`` will now flush the ``~/.bzr.log`` if it has been more
      than 2s since the last time it flushed. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * New method ``bzrlib.repository.Repository.add_inventory_by_delta``
      allows adding an inventory via an inventory delta, which can be
      more efficient for some repository types. (Robert Collins)

    * Repository ``CommitBuilder`` objects can now accumulate an inventory
      delta. To enable this functionality call ``builder.recording_deletes``
      and additionally call ``builder.record_delete`` when a delete
      against the basis occurs. (Robert Collins)

    * The default http handler has been changed from pycurl to urllib.
      The default is still pycurl for https connections. (The only
      advantage of pycurl is that it checks ssl certificates.)
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``VersionedFiles.get_record_stream()`` can now return objects with a
      storage_kind of ``chunked``. This is a collection (list/tuple) of
      strings. You can use ``osutils.chunks_to_lines()`` to turn them into
      guaranteed 'lines' or you can use ``''.join(chunks)`` to turn it
      into a fulltext. This allows for some very good memory savings when
      asking for many texts that share ancestry, as the individual chunks
      can be shared between versions of the file. (John Arbash Meinel)

    * ``pull -v`` and ``push -v`` use new function
      ``bzrlib.log.show_branch_change`` (Aaron Bentley)

I'm pleased to announce the 0.1 release of bzr-revnocache,
an experimental plugin that improves the performance of
bzr operations referencing merge revisions (i.e. those
with dotted revnos) on large projects. As an example,
"bzr status -r77537.1.3262" against the Emacs trunk on my
laptop takes 60 seconds without this plugin & 14 seconds
after installing it.

This release is a proof-of-concept only, suitable for
early adopter testing/hacking. Usage is trivial - install
the plugin and then forget about it (because it ought to
be completely transparent). The code may well be useful
for other bzr projects (though the API is not yet stable)
that need this information cached.

For more information including installation instructions,
see https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-revnocache.

Enjoy,
Ian C.

On behalf of the Bazaar team I'm happy to announce availability of the
first release candidate for bzr 1.12.

This release of Bazaar contains many improvements to the speed and
functionality of ``bzr log`` and the display of logged revisions by ``bzr
status``.  bzr now also gives a better indication of progress, both in the
way operations are drawn onto a text terminal, and by showing the rate of
network IO.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and
feedback.

bzr 1.12rc1 is available now as a source tarball from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download>.  Packages
for various systems will be available soon.

bzr 1.12rc1 "1234567890" 2009-02-10
-----------------------------------

This release of Bazaar contains many improvements to the speed and
functionality of ``bzr log`` and the display of logged revisions by ``bzr
status``.  bzr now also gives a better indication of progress, both in the
way operations are drawn onto a text terminal, and by showing the rate of
network IO.

  COMPATIBILITY BREAKS:

    * By default, ``bzr status`` after a merge now shows just the pending
      merge tip revisions. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio after
      merging from trunk and completes much faster. To see all merged
      revisions, use the new ``-v`` flag.  (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``bzr log --line`` now shows any tags after the date and before
      the commit message. If you have scripts which parse the output
      from this command, you may need to adjust them accordingly.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``bzr log --short`` now shows any additional revision properties
      after the date and before the commit message.  Scripts that parse
      output of the log command in this situation may need to adjust.
      (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

    * The experimental formats ``1.12-preview`` and ``1.12-preview-rich-root``
      have been renamed ``development-wt5`` and ``development-wt5-rich-root``
      respectively, given they are not ready for release in 1.12.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  NEW FEATURES:

    * Add support for filtering ``bzr missing`` on revisions.  Remote revisions
      can be filtered using ``bzr missing -r -20..-10`` and local revisions can
      be filtered using ``bzr missing --my-revision -20..-10``.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzr log -p`` displays the patch diff for each revision.
      When logging a file, the diff only includes changes to that file.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #202331, #227335)

    * ``bzr log`` supports a new option called ``-n N`` or ``--level N``.
      A value of 0 (zero) means "show all nested merge revisions" while
      a value of 1 (one) means "show just the top level". Values above
      1 can be used to see a limited amount of nesting. That can be
      useful for seeing the level or two below PQM submits for example.
      To force the ``--short`` and ``--line`` formats to display all nested
      merge revisions just like ``--long`` does by default, use a command
      like ``bzr log --short -n0``. To display just the mainline using
      ``--long`` format, ``bzr log --long -n1``.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr add`` more clearly communicates success vs failure.
      (Daniel Watkins)

    * ``bzr init`` will now print a little less verbose output.
      (Marius Kruger)

    * ``bzr log`` is now much faster in many use cases, particularly
      at incrementally displaying results and filtering by a
      revision range. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * ``bzr log --short`` and ``bzr log --line`` now show tags, if any,
      for each revision. The tags are shown comma-separated inside
      ``{}``. For short format, the tags appear at the end of line
      before the optional ``[merge]`` indicator. For line format,
      the tags appear after the date. (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Progress bars now show the rate of activity for some sftp
      operations, and they are drawn different.  (Martin Pool, #172741)

    * Progress bars now show the rate of activity for urllib and pycurl based
      http client implementations. The operations are tracked at the socket
      level for better precision.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Rule-based preferences can now accept multiple patterns for a set of
      rules.  (Marius Kruger)

    * The ``ancestor:`` revision spec will now default to referring to the
      parent of the branch if no other location is given.
      (Daniel Watkins, #198417)

    * The debugger started as a result of setting ``$BZR_PDB`` works
      around a bug in ``pdb``, http://bugs.python.org/issue4150.  The bug
      can cause truncated tracebacks in Python versions before 2.6.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * VirtualVersionedFiles now implements
      ``iter_lines_added_or_present_in_keys``. This allows the creation of
      new branches based on stacked bzr-svn branches. (#311997)

  BUG FIXES:

    * ``bzr annotate --show-ids`` doesn't give a backtrace on empty files
      anymore.
      (Anne Mohsen, Vincent Ladeuil, #314525)

    * ``bzr log FILE`` now correctly shows mainline revisions merging
      a change to FILE when the ``--short`` and ``--line`` log formats
      are used. (Ian Clatworthy, #317417)

    * ``bzr log -rX..Y FILE`` now shows the history of FILE provided
      it existed in Y or X, even if the file has since been deleted or
      renamed. If no range is given, the current/basis tree and
      initial tree are searched in that order. More generally, log
      now interprets filenames in their historical context.
      (Ian Clatworthy, #175520)

    * ``bzr status`` now reports nonexistent files and continues, then
       errors (with code 3) at the end.  (Karl Fogel, #306394)

    * Don't require the present compression base in knits to be the same
      when adding records in knits. (Jelmer Vernooij, #307394)

    * Fix a problem with CIFS client/server lag on Windows colliding with
      an invariant-per-process algorithm for generating AtomicFile names
      (Adrian Wilkins, #304023)

    * Many socket operations now handle EINTR by retrying the operation.
      Previously EINTR was treated as an unrecoverable failure.  There is
      a new ``until_no_eintr`` helper function in ``bzrlib.osutils``.
      (Andrew Bennetts)

    * Support symlinks with non-ascii characters in the symlink filename.
      (Jelmer Vernooij, #319323)

    * There was a bug in how we handled resolving when a file is deleted
      in one branch, and modified in the other. If there was a criss-cross
      merge, we would cause the deletion to conflict a second time.
      (Vincent Ladeuil, John Arbash Meinel)

    * There was another bug in how we chose the correct intermediate LCA in
      criss-cross merges leading to several kind of changes be incorrectly
      handled.
      (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Unshelve now handles deleted paths without crashing. (Robert Collins)

  DOCUMENTATION:

    * Improved plugin developer documentation.  (Martin Pool)

  API CHANGES:

    * ``ProgressBarStack`` is deprecated; instead use
      ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` to create new progress bars.
      (Martin Pool)

    * ForeignVcsMapping() now requires a ForeignVcs object as first
      argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * ForeignVcsMapping.show_foreign_revid() has been moved to
      ForeignVcs. (Jelmer Vernooij)

    * ``read_bundle_from_url`` is deprecated in favor of
      ``read_mergeable_from_url``.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * Revision specifiers are now registered in
      ``bzrlib.revisionspec.revspec_registry``, and the old list of
      revisionspec classes (``bzrlib.revisionspec.SPEC_TYPES``) has been
      deprecated. (Jelmer Vernooij, #321183)

    * The progress and UI classes have changed; the main APIs remain the
      same but code that provides a new UI or progress bar class may
      need to be updated.  (Martin Pool)

  INTERNALS:

    * Default User Interface (UI) is CLIUIFactory when bzr runs in a dumb
      terminal. It is sometimes desirable do override this default by forcing
      bzr to use TextUIFactory. This can be achieved by setting the
      BZR_USE_TEXT_UI environment variable (emacs shells, as opposed to
      compile buffers, are such an example).
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

    * New API ``Branch.iter_merge_sorted_revisions()`` that iterates over
      ``(revision_id, depth, revno, end_of_merge)`` tuples.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * New ``Branch.dotted_revno_to_revision_id()`` and
      ``Branch.revision_id_to_dotted_revno()`` APIs that pick the most
      efficient way of doing the mapping.
      (Ian Clatworthy)

    * Refactor cmd_serve so that it's a little easier to build commands that
      extend it, and perhaps even a bit easier to read.  (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``TreeDelta.show()`` now accepts a ``filter`` parameter allowing log
      formatters to retrict the output.
      (Vincent Ladeuil)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I just packaged a new bzr-1.12 windows installer. It seems the old one
accidentally included a DLL that was platform specific and caused
problems loading subvertpy on windows < 2003/Vista.

I also went ahead and packaged the latest bzr-svn (0.5.2) which is
supposed to have significant improvements.

On behalf of the Bazaar team I'm happy to announce availability of the =20=

first release candidate for bzr 1.13.

This release includes bug fixes and a few performance and feature =20
improvements. GNU Changelog output can now be produced by ``bzr log --=20=

format gnu-changelog``. Debug flags can now be set in ``~/.bazaar/=20
bazaar.conf``. Lightweight Checkouts and Stacked Branches should both =20=

be much faster over remote connections.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

bzr-1.13rc1 is now available for download from =
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download=20
  as a source tarball; packages for various systems will be available =20=

soon.

bzr 1.13rc1 "paraskavedekatriaphobia" 2009-03-06
------------------------------------------------

   COMPATIBILITY BREAKS:

     * ``bzr log --line`` now indicates which revisions are merges with
       `[merge]` after the date.  Scripts which parse the output of this
       command may need to be adjusted.
       (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

   NEW FEATURES:

     * ``bzr reconfigure`` now supports --with-trees and --with-no-trees
       options to change the default tree-creation policy of shared
       repositories.  (Matthew Fuller, Marius Kruger, #145033)

     * Debug flags can now be set in ``~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf``.
       (Martin Pool)

     * Filtered views provide a mask over the tree so that users can =20
focus
       on a subset of a tree when doing their work. See ``Filtered =20
views``
       in chapter 7 of the User Guide and ``bzr help view`` for details.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * GNU Changelog output can now be produced by ``bzr log --format
       gnu-changelog``.  (Andrea Bolognani, Martin Pool)

     * The ``-Dmemory`` flag now gives memory information on Windows.
       (John Arbash Meinel)

     * Multiple authors for a commit can now be recorded by using the =20=

"--author"
       option multiple times. (James Westby, #185772)

     * New command ``bzr launchpad-open`` opens a Launchpad web page =20
for that
       branch in your web browser, as long as the branch is on =20
Launchpad at all.
       (Jonathan Lange)

   IMPROVEMENTS:

     * ``bzr add`` no longer prints ``add completed`` on success. =20
Failure
       still prints an error message. (Robert Collins)

     * ``bzr branch`` now has a ``--no-tree`` option which turns off the
       generation of a working tree in the new branch.
       (Daniel Watkins, John Klinger, #273993)

     * Bazaar will now point out ``bzr+ssh://`` to the user when they
       use ssh://. (Jelmer Vernooij, #330535)

     * ``bzr -v info`` now omits the number of committers branch =20
statistic,
       making it many times faster for large projects. To include that
       statistic in the output, use ``bzr -vv info``.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * ``bzr push`` to a ``bzr`` url (``bzr://``, ``bzr+ssh://`` etc) =20=

will
       stream if the server is version 1.13 or greater, reducing =20
roundtrips
       significantly. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * Lightweight Checkouts and Stacked Branches should both be much
       faster over remote connections. Building the working tree now
       batches up requests into approx 5MB requests, rather than a =20
separate
       request for each file. (John Arbash Meinel)

     * Support for GSSAPI authentication when using HTTP or HTTPS.
       (Jelmer Vernooij)

     * The ``bzr shelve`` prompt now includes a '?' help option to =20
explain the
       short options better. (Daniel Watkins, #327429)

     * ``bzr lp-open`` now falls back to the push location if it =20
cannot find a
       public location. (Jonathan Lange, #332372)

     * ``bzr lp-open`` will try to find the Launchpad URL for the =20
location
       passed on the command line. This makes ``bzr lp-open lp:foo`` =20
work as
       expected. (Jonathan Lange, #332705)

     * ``bzr send`` now supports MH-E via ``emacsclient``. (Eric =20
Gillespie)

   BUG FIXES:

     * ``bzr missing`` now uses ``Repository.get_revision_delta()`` =20
rather
       than fetching trees and determining a delta itself. (Jelmer
       Vernooij, #315048)

     * ``bzr push`` to a smart server no longer causes "Revision
       {set([('null:',)])} not present ..." errors when the branch has
       multiple root revisions. (Andrew Bennetts, #317654)

     * ``bzr shelve`` now properly handle patches with no terminating =20=

newline.
       (Beno=EEt PIERRE, #303569)

     * ``bzr unshelve`` gives a more palatable error if passed a non-=20
integer
       shelf id. (Daniel Watkins)

     * Export now handles files that are not present in the tree.
       (James Westby, #174539)

     * Fixed "sprout() got an unexpected keyword argument =20
'source_branch'"
       error branching from old repositories.
       (Martin Pool, #321695)

     * Many Branch hooks would not fire with ``bzr://`` and ``bzr=20
+ssh://``
       branches, and this was not noticed due to a bug in the test logic
       for branches. This is now fixed and a test added to prevent it
       reoccuring. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Under rare circumstances (aka nobody reported a bug about it), =20=

the ftp
       transport could revert to ascii mode. It now stays in binary =20
mode except
       when needed.
       (Vincent Ladeuil)

     * Make ``bzr push --quiet <non-local location>`` less chatty.
       (Kent Gibson, #221461)

   DOCUMENTATION:

     * Added ``Organizing your workspace`` to the User Guide appendices,
       summarizing some common ways of organizing trees, branches and
       repositories and the processes/workflows implied/enabled by each.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * The documentation for ``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` has been =20
clarified.
       (Daniel Watkins, #327421, #327425)

   API CHANGES:

     * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if the bazaar sources contain trailing
       whitespace, non-unix style line endings and files not ending in a
       newline. About 372 files and 3243 lines with trailing =20
whitespace was
       updated to comply with this. The code already complied with the =20=

other
       criteria, but now it is enforced. (Marius Kruger)

     * ``Branch.fetch`` and ``Repository.fetch`` now return None rather
       than a count of copied revisions and failed revisions. A while =20=

back
       we stopped ever reporting failed revisions because we started
       erroring instead, and the copied revisions count is not used in =20=

the
       UI at all - indeed it only reflects the repository status not
       changes to the branch itself. (Robert Collins)

     * MutableTree.commit now favours the "authors" argument, with the =20=

old
       "author" argument being deprecated.

     * Remove deprecated EmptyTree.  (Martin Pool)

     * ``Repository.fetch`` now accepts an optional ``fetch_spec``
       parameter.  A ``SearchResult`` or ``MiniSearchResult`` may be =20
passed
       to ``fetch_spec`` instead of a ``last_revision`` to specify =20
exactly
       which revisions to fetch. (Andrew Bennetts)

     * ``RepositoryAcquisitionPolicy.acquire_repository`` now returns a
       tuple of ``(repository, is_new_flag)``, rather than just the
       repository.  (Andrew Bennetts)

     * Revision.get_apparent_author() is now deprecated, replaced by
       Revision.get_apparent_authors(), which returns a list. The former
       now returns the first item that would be returned from the =20
second.

     * The ``BranchBuilder`` test helper now accepts a ``timestamp``
       parameter to ``build_commit`` and ``build_snapshot``.  (Martin =20=

Pool)

     * The ``_fetch_*`` attributes on ``Repository`` are now on
       ``RepositoryFormat``, more accurately reflecting their intent =20
(they
       describe a disk format capability, not state of a particular
       repository of that format). (Robert Collins)

   INTERNALS:

     * Branching from a non-stacked branch on a smart protocol is now
       free of virtual file system methods.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Branch and Repository creation on a bzr+ssh://server are now done
       via RPC calls rather than VFS calls, reducing round trips for
       pushing new branches substantially. (Robert Collins)

     * ``Branch.clone`` now takes the ``repository_policy`` formerly =20
used
       inside ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport``, allowing stacking to be
       configured before the branch tags and revision tip are set. This
       fixes a race condition cloning stacked branches that would cause
       plugins to have hooks called on non-stacked instances.
       (Robert Collins, #334187)

     * ``BzrDir.cloning_metadir`` now has a RPC call. (Robert Collins)

     * ``BzrDirFormat.__str__`` now uses the human readable description
       rather than the sometimes-absent disk label. (Robert Collins)

     * ``bzrlib.fetch`` is now composed of a sender and a sink component
       allowing for decoupling over a network connection. Fetching from
       or into a RemoteRepository with a 1.13 server will use this to
       stream the operation.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``bzrlib.tests.run_suite`` accepts a runner_class parameter
       supporting the use of different runners. (Robert Collins)

     * New branch method ``create_clone_on_transport`` that returns a
       branch object. (Robert Collins)

     * New hook Commands['extend_command'] to allow plugins to access a
       command object before the command is run (or help generated from
       it), without overriding the command. (Robert Collins)

     * New version of the ``BzrDir.find_repository`` verb supporting
       ``_network_name`` to support removing more _ensure_real calls.
       (Robert Collins)

     * ``RemoteBranchFormat`` no longer claims to have a disk format =20
string.
       (Robert Collins)

     * ``Repository`` objects now have ``suspend_write_group`` and
       ``resume_write_group`` methods.  These are currently only useful
       with pack repositories. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``BzrDirFormat``, ``BranchFormat`` and ``RepositoryFormat`` =20
objects
       now have a ``network_name`` for passing the format across RPC =20
calls.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * ``RepositoryFormat`` objects now all have a new attribute
       ``_serializer`` used by fetch when reserialising is required.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Some methods have been pulled up from ``BzrBranch`` to ``Branch``
       to aid branch types that are not bzr branch objects (like
       RemoteBranch). (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * ``TestSkipped`` is now detected by TestCase and passed to the
       ``TestResult`` by calling ``addSkip``. For older TestResult =20
objects,
       where ``addSkip`` is not available, ``addError`` is still called.
       This permits test filtering in subunit to strip out skipped tests
       resulting in a faster fix-shrink-list-run cycle. This is =20
compatible
       with the testtools protocol for skips. (Robert Collins)

     * The ``_index`` of ``KnitVersionedFiles`` now supports the ability
       to scan an underlying index that is going to be incorporated into
       the ``KnitVersionedFiles`` object, to determine if it has missing
       delta references. The method is ``scan_unvalidated_index``.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * There is a RemoteSink object which handles pushing to smart =20
servers.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``TransportTraceDecorator`` now logs ``put_bytes_non_atomic`` and
       ``rmdir`` calls. (Robert Collins)

     * ``VersionedFiles`` record adapters have had their signature =20
change
       from ``(record, record.get_bytes_as(record.storage_kind))`` to
       ``(record)`` reducing excess duplication and allowing adapters
       to access private data in record to obtain content more
       efficiently. (Robert Collins)

I'm happy to announce the next minor release of bzr-svn, version 0.5.3.
This release fixes some more performance issues and several bugs.=20

The next release will hopefully be 1.0.0. bzr-svn is pretty much feature
complete now, and is waiting for some more changes to land in bzr core
so svn-push can be replace with standard push.

The changes since 0.5.2 are:

 BUG FIXES

   * Lazily load commands during help. (#330928)

   * Fix one-line helps for dpush / foreign-mapping-upgrade. (#331051)

   * Skip unicode tests if the local file system doesn't support
unicode=20
     paths.

   * Don't print traceback when connection errors occur during push.
(#331078)

   * Fix exception importing with itrunk* layout.

   * Break subversion locks in ``bzr break-lock''.

   * Handle corner case following branch paths outside of prefixes in=20
     revision metadata browser.

   * Handle strange corner case in HTTP, where get_dir() works on files
and we=20
     accidently start to call update() on files.

   * Don't check branch root when looking for round-tripped revisions
that used=20
     revision properties. (#294784)

   * Support non-ascii characters in home directories. (#333121)

   * Fix recognizing tags when using wildcard layouts. (#333960)

   * Fetch left-hand side ancestry if it's outside of the prefix in
     svn-import. (#334692)

   * Support pushing kind changes from directory to file. (#335445)

   * Fixed canonicalization issue when retrieving remote revision trees
     over HTTP.

   * Fix recognition of v3 mappings pushed with incomplete revision
properties.

   * Print proper error when a part of the repository is inaccessible
during=20
     fetch. (#323084)

   * Fix concurrent access problems during push/commit. (#248289)

   * Allow svn: revision specifier in non-svn branches. (#337295)

   * Cope with v3 and v4 mappings being interwined in a mainline=20
     with roundtripped revisions. (#332364)

   * Print proper error when it is impossible to get a branch path=20
     in a particular layout. (#340081)

  PERFORMANCE

   * Significant speed improvements when no (old) tags have to be
fetched. Requires=20
     InterBranch.pull() patch.

   * The guessed layout is now only stored in the configuration and no
longer=20
     re-determined every time a repository is accessed.

   * Looking for missing revisions is now done in groups, significantly
improving the=20
     time spent in the "determining revisions to fetch" step.

   * A simple LRU cache is now used for texts during fetch.

   * Avoid loading subvertpy in a couple more situations when probing
for=20
     Subversion repositories. (#336449)

  FEATURES

   * Now prints parent Subversion revision number after successful pull.
(#332196)

   * Annotate run against Subversion repositories now works. (#335735)


The release can be downloaded from:

bzr 1.13 "paraskavedekatriaphobia" 2009-03-14
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   CHANGES FROM bzr 1.13rc1 2009-03-10:

   BUG FIXES:

     * Fix "is not a stackable format" error when pushing a
       stackable-format branch with an unstackable-format repository =20
to a
       destination with a default stacking policy.  (Andrew Bennetts)

     * Progress bars now show the rate of network activity for
       ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``bzr://`` connections.  (Andrew Bennetts)

   COMPATIBILITY BREAKS:

     * ``bzr log --line`` now indicates which revisions are merges with
       `[merge]` after the date.  Scripts which parse the output of this
       command may need to be adjusted.
       (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

   NEW FEATURES:

     * ``bzr reconfigure`` now supports --with-trees and --with-no-trees
       options to change the default tree-creation policy of shared
       repositories.  (Matthew Fuller, Marius Kruger, #145033)

     * Debug flags can now be set in ``~/.bazaar/bazaar.conf``.
       (Martin Pool)

     * Filtered views provide a mask over the tree so that users can =20
focus
       on a subset of a tree when doing their work. See ``Filtered =20
views``
       in chapter 7 of the User Guide and ``bzr help view`` for details.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * GNU Changelog output can now be produced by ``bzr log --format
       gnu-changelog``.  (Andrea Bolognani, Martin Pool)

     * The ``-Dmemory`` flag now gives memory information on Windows.
       (John Arbash Meinel)

     * Multiple authors for a commit can now be recorded by using the =20=

"--author"
       option multiple times. (James Westby, #185772)

     * New clean-tree command, from bzrtools.  (Aaron Bentley, Jelmer =20=

Vernoij)

     * New command ``bzr launchpad-open`` opens a Launchpad web page =20
for that
       branch in your web browser, as long as the branch is on =20
Launchpad at all.
       (Jonathan Lange)

   IMPROVEMENTS:

     * ``bzr add`` no longer prints ``add completed`` on success. =20
Failure
       still prints an error message. (Robert Collins)

     * ``bzr branch`` now has a ``--no-tree`` option which turns off the
       generation of a working tree in the new branch.
       (Daniel Watkins, John Klinger, #273993)

     * Bazaar will now point out ``bzr+ssh://`` to the user when they
       use ssh://. (Jelmer Vernooij, #330535)

     * ``bzr -v info`` now omits the number of committers branch =20
statistic,
       making it many times faster for large projects. To include that
       statistic in the output, use ``bzr -vv info``.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * ``bzr push`` to a ``bzr`` url (``bzr://``, ``bzr+ssh://`` etc) =20=

will
       stream if the server is version 1.13 or greater, reducing =20
roundtrips
       significantly. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * Lightweight Checkouts and Stacked Branches should both be much
       faster over remote connections. Building the working tree now
       batches up requests into approx 5MB requests, rather than a =20
separate
       request for each file. (John Arbash Meinel)

     * Support for GSSAPI authentication when using HTTP or HTTPS.
       (Jelmer Vernooij)

     * The ``bzr shelve`` prompt now includes a '?' help option to =20
explain the
       short options better. (Daniel Watkins, #327429)

     * ``bzr lp-open`` now falls back to the push location if it =20
cannot find a
       public location. (Jonathan Lange, #332372)

     * ``bzr lp-open`` will try to find the Launchpad URL for the =20
location
       passed on the command line. This makes ``bzr lp-open lp:foo`` =20
work as
       expected. (Jonathan Lange, #332705)

     * ``bzr send`` now supports MH-E via ``emacsclient``. (Eric =20
Gillespie)

   BUG FIXES:

     * Bazaar now gives a better message including the filename if it's
       unable to read a file in the working directory, for example =20
because
       of a permission error.  (Martin Pool, #338653)

     * ``bzr send`` help is more specific about how to apply merge
       directives.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #253470)

     * ``bzr missing`` now uses ``Repository.get_revision_delta()`` =20
rather
       than fetching trees and determining a delta itself. (Jelmer
       Vernooij, #315048)

     * ``bzr push`` to a smart server no longer causes "Revision
       {set([('null:',)])} not present ..." errors when the branch has
       multiple root revisions. (Andrew Bennetts, #317654)

     * ``bzr shelve`` now properly handle patches with no terminating =20=

newline.
       (Beno=EEt PIERRE, #303569)

     * ``bzr unshelve`` gives a more palatable error if passed a non-=20
integer
       shelf id. (Daniel Watkins)

     * Export now handles files that are not present in the tree.
       (James Westby, #174539)

     * Fixed "sprout() got an unexpected keyword argument =20
'source_branch'"
       error branching from old repositories.
       (Martin Pool, #321695)

     * Make ``bzr push --quiet <non-local location>`` less chatty.
       (Kent Gibson, #221461)

     * Many Branch hooks would not fire with ``bzr://`` and ``bzr=20
+ssh://``
       branches, and this was not noticed due to a bug in the test logic
       for branches. This is now fixed and a test added to prevent it
       reoccuring. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Restore the progress bar on Windows. We were disabling it when =20=

TERM
       wasn't set, but Windows doesn't set TERM. (Alexander Belchenko)

     * ``setup.py build_ext`` now gives a proper error when an extension
       fails to build. (John Arbash Meinel)

     * Symlinks to non ascii file names are now supported.
       (Robert Collins, Vincent Ladeuil, #339055, #272444)

     * Under rare circumstances (aka nobody reported a bug about it), =20=

the ftp
       transport could revert to ascii mode. It now stays in binary =20
mode except
       when needed.
       (Vincent Ladeuil)

     * Unshelve does not generate warnings about progress bars.
       (Aaron Bentley, #328148)

   DOCUMENTATION:

     * Added ``Organizing your workspace`` to the User Guide appendices,
       summarizing some common ways of organizing trees, branches and
       repositories and the processes/workflows implied/enabled by each.
       (Ian Clatworthy)

     * Hooks can now be self documenting. =20
``bzrlib.hooks.Hooks.create_hook``
       is the entry point for this feature. (Robert Collins)

     * The documentation for ``shelve`` and ``unshelve`` has been =20
clarified.
       (Daniel Watkins, #327421, #327425)

   API CHANGES:

     * ``bzr selftest`` now fails if the bazaar sources contain trailing
       whitespace, non-unix style line endings and files not ending in a
       newline. About 372 files and 3243 lines with trailing =20
whitespace was
       updated to comply with this. The code already complied with the =20=

other
       criteria, but now it is enforced. (Marius Kruger)

     * ``Branch.fetch`` and ``Repository.fetch`` now return None rather
       than a count of copied revisions and failed revisions. A while =20=

back
       we stopped ever reporting failed revisions because we started
       erroring instead, and the copied revisions count is not used in =20=

the
       UI at all - indeed it only reflects the repository status not
       changes to the branch itself. (Robert Collins)

     * MutableTree.commit now favours the "authors" argument, with the =20=

old
       "author" argument being deprecated.

     * Remove deprecated EmptyTree.  (Martin Pool)

     * ``Repository.fetch`` now accepts an optional ``fetch_spec``
       parameter.  A ``SearchResult`` or ``MiniSearchResult`` may be =20
passed
       to ``fetch_spec`` instead of a ``last_revision`` to specify =20
exactly
       which revisions to fetch. (Andrew Bennetts)

     * ``RepositoryAcquisitionPolicy.acquire_repository`` now returns a
       tuple of ``(repository, is_new_flag)``, rather than just the
       repository.  (Andrew Bennetts)

     * Revision.get_apparent_author() is now deprecated, replaced by
       Revision.get_apparent_authors(), which returns a list. The former
       now returns the first item that would be returned from the =20
second.

     * The ``BranchBuilder`` test helper now accepts a ``timestamp``
       parameter to ``build_commit`` and ``build_snapshot``.  (Martin =20=

Pool)

     * The ``_fetch_*`` attributes on ``Repository`` are now on
       ``RepositoryFormat``, more accurately reflecting their intent =20
(they
       describe a disk format capability, not state of a particular
       repository of that format). (Robert Collins)

   INTERNALS:

     * Branching from a non-stacked branch on a smart protocol is now
       free of virtual file system methods.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Branch and Repository creation on a bzr+ssh://server are now done
       via RPC calls rather than VFS calls, reducing round trips for
       pushing new branches substantially. (Robert Collins)

     * ``Branch.clone`` now takes the ``repository_policy`` formerly =20
used
       inside ``BzrDir.clone_on_transport``, allowing stacking to be
       configured before the branch tags and revision tip are set. This
       fixes a race condition cloning stacked branches that would cause
       plugins to have hooks called on non-stacked instances.
       (Robert Collins, #334187)

     * ``BzrDir.cloning_metadir`` now has a RPC call. (Robert Collins)

     * ``BzrDirFormat.__str__`` now uses the human readable description
       rather than the sometimes-absent disk label. (Robert Collins)

     * ``bzrlib.fetch`` is now composed of a sender and a sink component
       allowing for decoupling over a network connection. Fetching from
       or into a RemoteRepository with a 1.13 server will use this to
       stream the operation.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``bzrlib.tests.run_suite`` accepts a runner_class parameter
       supporting the use of different runners. (Robert Collins)

     * Change how file_ids and revision_ids are interned as part of
       inventory deserialization. Now we use the real ``intern()``, =20
rather
       than our own workaround that would also cache a Unicode copy of =20=

the
       string, and never emptied the cache. This should slightly reduce
       memory consumption. (John Arbash Meinel)

     * New branch method ``create_clone_on_transport`` that returns a
       branch object. (Robert Collins)

     * New hook Commands['extend_command'] to allow plugins to access a
       command object before the command is run (or help generated from
       it), without overriding the command. (Robert Collins)

     * New version of the ``BzrDir.find_repository`` verb supporting
       ``_network_name`` to support removing more _ensure_real calls.
       (Robert Collins)

     * ``RemoteBranchFormat`` no longer claims to have a disk format =20
string.
       (Robert Collins)

     * ``Repository`` objects now have ``suspend_write_group`` and
       ``resume_write_group`` methods.  These are currently only useful
       with pack repositories. (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``BzrDirFormat``, ``BranchFormat`` and ``RepositoryFormat`` =20
objects
       now have a ``network_name`` for passing the format across RPC =20
calls.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * ``RepositoryFormat`` objects now all have a new attribute
       ``_serializer`` used by fetch when reserialising is required.
       (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Some methods have been pulled up from ``BzrBranch`` to ``Branch``
       to aid branch types that are not bzr branch objects (like
       RemoteBranch). (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

     * Test adaptation has been made consistent throughout the built in
       tests. ``TestScenarioApplier``, ``multiply_tests_from_modules``,
       ``adapt_tests``, ``adapt_modules`` have all been deleted. Please
       use ``multiply_tests``, or for lower level needs =20
``apply_scenarios``
       and ``apply_scenario``. (Robert Collins)

     * ``TestSkipped`` is now detected by TestCase and passed to the
       ``TestResult`` by calling ``addSkip``. For older TestResult =20
objects,
       where ``addSkip`` is not available, ``addError`` is still called.
       This permits test filtering in subunit to strip out skipped tests
       resulting in a faster fix-shrink-list-run cycle. This is =20
compatible
       with the testtools protocol for skips. (Robert Collins)

     * The ``_index`` of ``KnitVersionedFiles`` now supports the ability
       to scan an underlying index that is going to be incorporated into
       the ``KnitVersionedFiles`` object, to determine if it has missing
       delta references. The method is ``scan_unvalidated_index``.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * There is a RemoteSink object which handles pushing to smart =20
servers.
       (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

     * ``TransportTraceDecorator`` now logs ``put_bytes_non_atomic`` and
       ``rmdir`` calls. (Robert Collins)

     * ``VersionedFiles`` record adapters have had their signature =20
change
       from ``(record, record.get_bytes_as(record.storage_kind))`` to
       ``(record)`` reducing excess duplication and allowing adapters
       to access private data in record to obtain content more
       efficiently. (Robert Collins)

     * We no longer probe to see if we should create a working tree =20
during
       clone if we cannot get a local_abspath for the new bzrdir.
       (Robert Collins)


bzr 1.12 "1234567890" 2009-02-13
--------------------------------

This release of Bazaar contains many improvements to the speed,
documentation and functionality of ``bzr log`` and the display of logged
revisions by ``bzr status``.  bzr now also gives a better indication of
progress, both in the way operations are drawn onto a text terminal, and
by showing the rate of network IO.

   BUG FIXES:

     * ``bzr init --development-wt5[-rich-root]`` would fail because of
       circular import errors. (John Arbash Meinel, #328135)

   DOCUMENTATION:

     * Expanded the help for log and added a new help topic called
       ``log-formats``.  (Ian Clatworthy)

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* A previously disabled code path to accelerate getting configuration
   settings from a smart server has been reinstated. We think this *may*
   cause a incompatibility with servers older than bzr 0.15. We intend
   to issue a point release to address this if it turns out to be a
   problem. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* bzr no longer autodetects nested trees as 'tree-references'.  They
   must now be explicitly added tree references.  At the commandline,  
use
   join --reference instead of add.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The ``--long`` log format (the default) no longer shows merged
   revisions implicitly, making it consistent with the ``short`` and
   ``line`` log formats.  To see merged revisions for just a given
   revision, use ``bzr log -n0 -rX``. To see every merged revision,
   use ``bzr log -n0``.  (Ian Clatworthy)

New Features
************

* New formats ``1.14`` and ``1.14-rich-root`` supporting End-Of-Line
   (EOL) conversions, keyword templating (via the bzr-keywords plugin)
   and generic content filtering. These formats replace the experimental
   ``development-wt5`` and ``development-wt5-rich-root`` formats
   respectively, but have support for filtered views disabled.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* New ``mv --auto`` option recognizes renames after they occur.
   (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr log`` now supports filtering of multiple files and directories
   and will show changes that touch any of them. Furthermore,
   directory filtering now shows the changes to any children of that
   directory, not just the directory object itself.
   (Ian Clatworthy, #97715)

* ``bzr shelve`` can now apply changes without storing anything on the
   shelf, via the new --destroy option.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr send`` now accepts --body to specify an initial message body.
   (Aaron bentley)

* ``bzr xxx --usage`` where xxx is a command now shows a usage
   message and the options without the descriptive help sections
   (like Description and Examples). A message is also given
   explaining how to see the complete help, i.e. ``bzr help xxx``.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* Content filters can now be used to provide custom conversion
   between the canonical format of content (i.e. as stored) and
   the convenience format of content (i.e. as created in working
   trees). See ``bzr help content-filters`` for further details.
   (Ian Clatworthy, Alexander Belchenko)

* End-of-line conversion is now supported for formats supporting
   content filtering. See ``bzr help eol`` for details.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

Improvements
************

* A new format name alias ``default-rich-root`` has been added and
   points at the closest relative of the default format that supports
   rich roots. (Jelmer Vernooij, #338061)

* Branching from a stacked branch using ``bzr*://`` will now stream
   the data when the target repository does not need topological
   ordering, reducing round trips and network overhead. This uses the
   existing smart server methods added in 1.13, so will work on any
   1.13 or newer server. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr cat`` and ``bzr export`` now supports a ``--filters`` option
   that displays/saves the content after content filters are applied.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr ignore`` gives a more informative message when existing
   version controlled files match the ignore pattern. (Neil
   Martinsen-Burrell, #248895)

* ``bzr send`` is faster on repositories with deep histories.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* Progress bars now show the rate of network activity for
   ``bzr+ssh://`` and ``bzr://`` connections.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Pushing to a stacked pack-format branch on a 1.12 or older smart  
server
   now takes many less round trips.  (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins,
   #294479)

* Streaming push can be done to older repository formats.  This is
   implemented using a new ``Repository.insert_stream_locked`` RPC.
   (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* The "ignoring files outside view: .." message has been re-worded
   to "Ignoring files outside view. View is .." to reduce confusion
   about what was being considered and what was being ignored.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``long`` log formatter now shows [merge] indicators. If
   only one level of revisions is displayed and merges are found,
   the ``long`` and ``short`` log formatters now tell the user
   how to see the hidden merged revisions.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``brisbane-core`` project has delivered its beta format
   ``development6-rich-root``. This format is suitable for judicious
   testing by early adopters. In particular if you are benchmarking bzr
   performance please be sure to test using this format. At this stage
   more information is best obtained by contacting the Bazaar mailing  
list
   or IRC channel if you are interested in using this format. We will  
make
   end user documentation available closer to blessing the format as
   production ready. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, Ian  
Clatworthy,
   Vincent Ladeuil, Andrew Bennetts, Martin Pool)

* Tildes are no longer escaped. No more %7Euser/project/branch!
   (Jonathan Lange)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Authentication plugins now receive all the parameters from the request
   itself (aka host, port, realm, path, etc). Previously, only the
   authentication section name, username and encoded password were
   provided. (Jean-Francois Roy)

* bzr gives a better message if an invalid regexp is passed to ``bzr log
   -m``.  (Anne Mohsen, Martin Pool)

* Fix "is not a stackable format" error when pushing a
   stackable-format branch with an unstackable-format repository to a
   destination with a default stacking policy.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Fixed incorrect "Source format does not support stacking" warning
   when pushing to a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #334114)

* Fix 'make check-dist-tarball' failure by converting paths to unicode  
when
   needed. (Vincent Ladeuil, #355454)

* Fixed "Specified file 'x/y/z' is outside current view: " occurring
   on ``bzr add x/y/z`` in formats supporting views when no view is
   defined.  (Ian Clatworthy, #344708)

* It is no longer possible to fetch between repositories while the
   target repository is in a write group. This prevents race conditions
   that prevent the use of RPC's to perform fetch, and thus allows
   optimising more operations. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``merge --force`` works again. (Robert Collins, #342105)

* No more warnings are issued about ``sha`` being deprecated under  
python-2.6.
   (Vincent Ladeuil, #346593)

* Pushing a new branch to a server that has a stacking policy will now
   upgrade from the local branch format when the stacking policy  
points at
   a branch which is itself stackable, because we know the client can  
read
   both branches, we know that the trunk for the project can be read  
too,
   so the upgrade will not inconvenience users. (Robert Collins,  
#345169)

* The full test suite is passing again on OSX. Several minor issues  
(mostly
   test related) have been fixed. (Vincent Ladeuil, #355273).

* The GNU Changelog formatter is slightly improved in the case where
   the delta is empty, and now correctly claims not to support tags.
   (Andrea Bolognani)

* Shelve can now shelve changes to a symlink target.
   (James Westby, #341558)

* The help for the ``info`` command has been corrected.
   (Ian Clatworthy, #351931)

* Upgrade will now use a sensible default format if the source  
repository
   uses rich roots.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #252908)

Documentation
*************

* Expanded the index of the developer documentation. (Eric Siegerman)

* New topic `bzr help debug-flags`.  (Martin Pool)

* The generated manpage now explicitly lists aliases as commands.
   (James Westby, #336998)

API Changes
***********

* APIs deprecated in 1.6 and previous verisons of bzr are now removed.
   (Martin Pool)

* ``CommitReporter`` is no longer called with ``unchanged`` status  
during
   commit - this was a full-tree overhead that bzr no longer performs.
   (Robert Collins)

* New API ``Inventory.filter()`` added that filters an inventory by
   a set of file-ids so that only those fileids, their parents and
   their children are included.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* New sort order for ``get_record_stream`` ``groupcompress`` which
   sorts optimally for use with groupcompress compressors. (John Arbash
   Meinel, Robert Collins)

* Repository APIs ``get_deltas_for_revisions()`` and
   ``get_revision_delta()`` now support an optional ``specific_fileids``
   parameter. If provided, the deltas are filtered so that only those
   file-ids, their parents and their children are included.
   (Ian Clatworthy)

* The ``get_credentials`` and ``set_credentials`` methods of
   ``AuthenticationConfig`` now accept an optional realm argument.
   (Jean-Francois Roy)

* The ``pb`` argument to ``fetch()`` is deprecated.
   (Martin Pool)

* The smart server jail now hooks into BzrDir.open to prevent any BzrDir
   that is not inside the backing transport from being opened.  See the
   module documentation for ``bzrlib.smart.request`` for details.
   (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``Tree.get_symlink_target`` now always returns a unicode string result
   or None. Previously it would return the bytes from reading the link
   which could be in any arbitrary encoding. (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* ``bzrlib.tests.TestCase`` now fails the test if its own ``setUp``
   and ``tearDown`` weren't called.  This catches faulty tests that
   forget to upcall when overriding ``setUp`` and ``tearDown``.  Those
   faulty tests were not properly isolated.
   (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* Fix test_msgeditor.MsgEditorTest test isolation.
   (Vincent Ladeuil, #347130)

* ``medusa`` is not used anymore as an FTP test server starting with
   python2.6. A new FTP test server based on ``pyftplib`` can be used
   instead. This new server is a soft dependency as medusa which is  
still
   preferred if both are available (modulo python version).
   (Vincent Ladeuil)

Internals
*********

* Added ``chk_map`` for fast, trie-based storage of tuple to string  
maps.
   (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``Branch._get_config`` has been added, which splits out access to the
   specific config file from the branch. This is used to let  
RemoteBranch
   avoid constructing real branch objects to access configuration  
settings.
   (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Branch`` now implements ``set_stacked_on_url`` in the base class as
   the implementation is generic and should impact foreign formats. This
   helps performance for ``RemoteBranch`` push operations to new stacked
   branches. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``BtreeIndex._spill_mem_keys_to_disk()`` now generates disk index with
   optmizations turned off. This only has effect when processing >  
100,000
   keys during something like ``bzr pack``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr selftest`` now accepts ``--subunit`` to run in subunit output
   mode. Requires ``lp:subunit`` installed to work, but is not a hard
   dependency. (Robert Collins)

* ``BzrDir.open_branch`` now takes an optional ``ignore_fallbacks``
   parameter for controlling opening of stacked branches.
   (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

* ``CommitBuilder`` has a new method, ``record_iter_changes`` which  
works
   in terms of an iter_changes iterator rather than full tree scanning.
   (Robert Collins)

* ``DirState`` can now be passed a custom ``SHA1Provider`` object
   enabling it to store the SHA1 and stat of the canonical (post
   content filtered) form. (Ian Clatworthy)

* New ``assertLength`` method based on one Martin has squirreled away
   somewhere. (Robert Collins, Martin Pool)

* New hook ``BzrDir.pre_open`` which runs before opening ``BzrDir``
   objects, allowing better enforcement of the smart server jail when
   dealing with stacked branches. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* New repository method ``refresh_data`` to cause any repository to
   make visible data inserted into the repository by a smart server
   fetch operation. (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``register_filter_stack_map`` now takes an optional fallback  
parameter,
   a callable to invoke if a preference has a value not in the map
   of filter stacks. This enhancement allows, for example,  bzr-svn to
   handle existing svn properties that define a list of keywords to be
   expanded.  (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``RemoteBranchConfig`` will use a new verb  
``Branch.set_config_option``
   to write config settings to smart servers that support this, saving
   5 round trips on the stacked streaming acceptance test.
   (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RemoteBranch`` now provides ``_get_config`` for access to just the
   branch specific configuration from a remote server, which uses the
   already existing ``Branch.get_config_file`` smart verb.
   (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RemoteRepository`` will now negatively cache missing revisions  
during
   ``get_parent_map`` while read-locked. Write-locks are unaffected.
   (Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts)

* Removed ``InterRemoteToOther``, ``InterOtherToRemote`` and
   ``InterPackToRemotePack`` classes, as they are now unnecessary.
   (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``RepositoryFormat`` as a new attribute ``fast_deltas`` to indicate
   whether the repository can efficiently generate deltas between trees
   regardless of tree size. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.iter_files_bytes()`` now properly returns an "iterable of
   byte strings" (aka 'chunked') for the content. It previously was
   returning a plain string, which worked, but performed very poorly  
when
   building a working tree (file.writelines(str) is very inefficient).  
This
   can have a large effect on ``bzr checkout`` times. (John Arbash  
Meinel)

* selftest now supports a --parallel option, with values of 'fork' or
   'subprocess' to run the test suite in parallel. Currently only linux
   machine work, other platforms need patches submitted. (Robert  
Collins,
   Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``tests.run_suite`` has a new parameter ``suite_decorators``, a list  
of
   callables to use to decorate the test suite. Such decorators can  
add or
   remove tests, or even remote the test suite to another machine if
   desired. (Robert Collins)

* The smart server verb ``Repository.get_parent_map`` can now include
   information about ghosts when the special revision ``include- 
missing:``
   is in the requested parents map list. With this flag, ghosts are
   included as ``missing:REVISION_ID``. (Robert Collins, Andrew  
Bennetts)

* ``_walk_to_common_revisions`` will now batch up at least 50
   revisions before calling ``get_parent_map`` on the target,
   regardless of ``InterRepository``.
   (Andrew Bennetts, Robert Collins)

I'm happy to announce the next minor release of bzr-svn, version 0.5.4.
This release fixes some more performance issues and several bugs. This
will most likely be the last release in the 0.5 series.

The changes since 0.5.3 are:

  BUG FIXES

   * Ignore spurious commits setting tags to the same revision. (#342824)

   * Fix compatibility with Python2.4.

   * Improve error message if subvertpy can't be found. (#345067)

   * Cope with spaces in branch paths. (#348439)

   * Properly deal with pointless commits when branching the
     repository root. (#348786)

   * dpush no longer sets custom bzr revision properties. (#351292)

   * Re-use passwords that have been prompted earlier. (#331073)

   * Fix compatibility with Bazaar 1.14.

  FEATURES

   * A new content filter "svn-keywords" is now supported and behaves like
     the svn:keywords Subversion file property.

   * Keywords and end of line properties in svn working copies are now
honored.
     (#81463)

   * Support override-svn-revprops = svn:author=author to allow
svn:author to be
     set to the author of a pushed revision rather than the committer.
(#342979)


The release can be downloaded from:

 http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-svn-0.5.4.tar.gz

A signature of this tarball made with my GPG key (1EEF5276) can be found
here:

Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 1.14.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 1.14.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:

- - New conflict-diff command, for doing diffs to understand conflicts
  better.
- - Improved compatibility of import command with Python2.6: prefix
  stripping now works again.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.14.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.14/+download/bzrtools-1.14.0.tar.gz
http://edge.launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/1.14/+download/bzrtools-1.14.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

A regression was found in the 1.13.1 release. When bzr 1.13.1 and  
earlier push a stacked branch they do not take care to push all the  
parent inventories for the transferred revisions. This means that a  
smart server serving that branch often cannot calculate inventory  
deltas for the branch (because smart server does not/cannot open  
fallback repositories). Prior to 1.13 the server did not have a verb  
to stream revisions out of a repository, so that's why this bug has  
appeared now.

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of  
the bzr adaptive version control system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Changelog
---------
 * qlog:
    * Added search for tags and bugs.
    * Fixed a bug with qlog FILE where it was not showing revisions if the
      revision that changed the file had been merge into another branch before
      it was merged into the mainline. (Bug #350166)
    * Fixed a bug when clicking refresh with multiple branches open.
      (Bug #351633)
    * When viewing a remote branch, qlog will load the revisions from local
      current directory if availible.
    * Improvements to the graph layout.
    * When opening diffs, there is less of a delay.
    * When running qlog DIR, revisions that change the children of the directory
      are also displayed. This only works if you are using bzr 1.14.
      (Bug #314528)
    * When runing qlog FILE1 FILE2 or qlog DIR, changes to the specified files are
      displayed in bold. By default diff will show changes only to selected
      items. Full diff could be invoked via context menu.
    * Add context menu to file list.
 * qannotate:
    * Use the log widget to display the revision list with a folding graph. The
      graph can be disabled by using the --no-graph command line argument.
      (Bug #328595)
    * Fixed a bug where qannotate crashes if you scroll to the bottom of the
      file and the file's last line is blank. (Bug #340956)
    * Add option to the log context menu to select a revision to annotate.
 * qcommit:
    * Use the log widget to display the pending merges list with a folding
      graph. (Bug #328592)
 * qdiff:
    * Fixed a bug with the error reporting when launching external diffs.
 * qpull/qpush/qmerge:
    * If there is no default saved location then set focus on URL combobox

The smart server will no longer raise 'NoSuchRevision' when streaming  
content with a size mismatch in a reconstructed graph search. New  
command ``bzr dpush``. Plugins can now define their own annotation tie  
breaker when two revisions introduce the exact same line.

Changes from 1.15final to 1.15.1

Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a  
``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.  
This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like  
``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Bazaar 1.13 introduced streaming fetch over the bzr:// protocol, which
makes push and pull operations substantially faster.  Unfortunately
due to mismatches with existing code this does not operate correctly
on stacked branches in many cases.  The server is unable to correctly
determine the deltas to send and gives an error when you next try to
pull from an affected branch.

If you are not using stacked branches this does not affect you.
Bazaar will not create stacked branches by default unless you specify
the --stacked option to push/branch, or set a server-side policy for
them. Launchpad sets a server-side policy for stacking - users of
Launchpad will be using stacked branches. You can tell if a branch is
stacked by running 'bzr info BRANCHURL' and looking for
   stacked on: URL
in the output.

If you are using stacked branches, then using bzr versions before
1.13.2, 1.14.2 or 1.14 and above may create repositories that cannot be
streamed from.

A fix for this issue in included in bzr 1.15.

There is another potential failure mode that may affect projects using
bzr-svn, or migrating from GNU Arch. If you encounter a 'Revision
REVISIONID not present' error when branching, you may be suffering
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/368418. A fix for this was also
included in 1.15.


Resolving this issue
--------------------

Existing branches which are affected require a script run on them to fix
them. The script and instructions are in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-code/+bug/354036.

To avoid the bug, bzr needs to be either updated to the current
version from bzr.dev, or you can apply the patches listed below.

If you are using Ubuntu, packages of bzr.dev are available via the
nightly Personal Package Archive
https://launchpad.net/~bzr-nightly-ppa/+archive/ppa.

On the bzr server:
Apply http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr/bzr/trunk/revision/4307, as per
https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-code/+bug/354036. This is included
in bzr 1.15.
Apply http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr/bzr/trunk/revision/4342, as per
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bzr/+bug/360791. This is
included in bzr 1.15.

On client machines:
Run bzr 1.13.2 or bzr 1.14.2. Older versions of bzr will continue to
create problematic branches that will require the fixer script in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad-code/+bug/354036 to be run against
them.

For further information and support please contact the Bazaar community
via https://answers.launchpad.net/bzr, #bzr on irc.freenode.net, or
bazaar@lists.canonical.com.

On behalf of QBzr developers team I'd like to announce release of QBzr 0.11.
Main goal of this release is to provide version of QBzr compatible with changes
made in bzr 1.16.

What's in this release
----------------------
Maintenance release: compatibility with bzr 1.16 (bencode releated changes),
improved performance of qlog, more fixes for side-by-side qdiff, a dozen of
various bugfixes.

Windows standalone installer for QBzr now built with Inno Setup.
Now user can install only main QBzr files without additional libraries
(e.g. PyQt4). So this installer now can be used to upgrade copy of QBzr plugin
installed as part of standalone bzr.exe installer.

 * qbrowse:
    * Fix problem with opening the log for file/directory. (#383192)
 * qinfo:
    * Add a basic help string (#384632)
 * qview command renamed to qviewer (previously qviewer was alias for qview)
   to avoid confusion with bzr views feature. (#385225)

NOTES: when upgrading your standalone installation of qbzr (on Windows)
you should uninstall old QBzr first, and then re-install it from new installer.

Bazaar 1.16rc1, codename "It's yesterday in California" is released!

This version of Bazaar contains the beta release of the new ``2a`` repository
format, suitable for testing by fearless, advanced users. This format or an
updated version of it will become the default format in Bazaar 2.0. Please
read the NEWS entry before even thinking about upgrading to the new format.

Also included are speedups for many operations on huge projects, a bug fix for
pushing stacked new stacked branches to smart servers and the usual bevy of
bug fixes and improvements.

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the bzr adaptive version control system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball; packages for
various systems will be available soon.

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* Display prompt on stderr (instead of stdout) when querying users so
  that the output of commands can be safely redirected.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #376582)


New Features
************

* A new repository format ``2a`` has been added.  This is a beta release
  of the the brisbane-core (aka group-compress) project.  This format now
  suitable for wider testing by advanced users willing to deal with some
  bugs.  We would appreciate test reports, either positive or negative.
  Format 2a is substantially smaller and faster for many operations on
  many trees.  This format or an updated version will become the default
  in bzr 2.0.

  This is a rich-root format, so this repository format can be used with
  bzr-svn.  Bazaar branches in previous non-rich-root formats can be
  converted (including by merge, push and pull) to format 2a, but not vice
  versa.  We recommend upgrading previous development formats to 2a.

  Upgrading to this format can take considerable time because it expands
  and more concisely repacks the full history.

  If you use stacked branches, you must upgrade the stacked branches
  before the stacked-on branches.  (See
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/374735>)

* ``--development7-rich-root`` is a new dev format, similar to ``--dev6``
  but using a Revision serializer using bencode rather than XML.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)

* mail_client=claws now supports --body (and message body hooks).  Also uses
  configured from address.  (Barry Warsaw)


Improvements
************


* ``--development6-rich-root`` can now stack. (Modulo some smart-server
  bugs with stacking and non default formats.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #373455)

* ``--development6-rich-root`` delays generating a delta index for the
  first object inserted into a group. This has a beneficial impact on
  ``bzr commit`` since each committed texts goes to its own group. For
  committing a 90MB file, it drops peak memory by about 200MB, and speeds
  up commit from 7s => 4s. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Numerous operations are now faster for huge projects, i.e. those
  with a large number of files and/or a large number of revisions,
  particularly when the latest development format is used. These
  operations (and improvements on OpenOffice.org) include:

  * branch in a shared repository (2X faster)
  * branch --no-tree (100X faster)
  * diff (2X faster)
  * tags (70X faster)

  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Pyrex version of ``bencode`` support. This provides optimized support
  for both encoding and decoding, and is now found at ``bzrlib.bencode``.
  ``bzrlib.utils.bencode`` is now deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko, Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar can now pass attachment files to the mutt email client.
  (Edwin Grubbs, #384158)

* Better message in ``bzr add`` output suggesting using ``bzr ignored`` to
  see which files can also be added.  (Jason Spashett, #76616)

* ``bzr pull -r 123`` from a stacked branch on a smart server no longer fails.
  Also, the ``Branch.revision_history()`` API now works in the same
  situation.  (Andrew Bennetts, #380314)

* ``bzr serve`` on Windows no longer displays a traceback simply because a
  TCP client disconnected. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Clarify the rules for locking and fallback repositories. Fix bugs in how
  ``RemoteRepository`` was handling fallbacks along with the
  ``_real_repository``. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #375496)

* Fix a small bug with fetching revisions w/ ghosts into a new stacked
  branch. Not often triggered, because it required ghosts to be part of
  the fetched revisions, not in the stacked-on ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix status and commit to work with content filtered trees, addressing
  numerous bad bugs with line-ending support. (Ian Clatworthy, #362030)

* Fix problem of "directory not empty" when contending for a lock over
  sftp.  (Martin Pool, #340352)

* Fix rule handling so that eol is optional, not mandatory.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #379370)

* Pushing a new stacked branch to a 1.15 smart server was broken due to a
  bug in the ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` smart verb.  This is fixed in
  1.16, but required changes to the network protocol, so the
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` verb has been removed and replaced with a
  corrected ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex_1.16`` verb.  1.15 clients will
  still work with a 1.16 server as they will fallback to slower (and
  bug-free) methods.
  (Jonathan Lange, Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts, #385132)

* Reconcile can now deal with text revisions that originated in revisions
  that are ghosts. (Jelmer Vernooij, #336749)

* Support cloning of branches with ghosts in the left hand side history.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #248540)

* The ''bzr diff'' now catches OSError from osutils.rmtree and logs a
  helpful message to the trace file, unless the temp directory really was
  removed (which would be very strange).  Since the diff operation has
  succeeded from the user's perspective, no output is written to stderr
  or stdout.  (Maritza Mendez, #363837)

* Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.
  This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like
  ``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in Russian.
  (Alexey Shtokalo, Alexander Iljin, Alexander Belchenko, Dmitry Vasiliev,
  Volodymyr Kotulskyi)


API Changes
***********

* Added osutils.parent_directories(). (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzrlib.progress.ProgressBar``, ``ChildProgress``, ``DotsProgressBar``,
  ``TTYProgressBar`` and ``child_progress`` are now deprecated; use
  ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``graph.StackedParentsProvider`` is now a public API, replacing
  ``graph._StackedParentsProvider``. The api is now considered stable and ready
  for external users. (Gary van der Merwe)

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``get_user_encoding``.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* TreeTransformBase no longer assumes that limbo is provided via disk.
  DiskTreeTransform now provides disk functionality.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Remove ``weave.py`` script for accessing internals of old weave-format
  repositories.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* The number of cores is now correctly detected on OSX. (John Szakmeister)

* The number of cores is also detected on Solaris and win32. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The number of cores is also detected on FreeBSD. (Matthew Fuller)

Bazaar 1.16, codename "It's yesterday in California" is released!

This version of Bazaar contains the beta release of the new ``2a``
repository format, suitable for testing by fearless, advanced users.
This format or an updated version of it will become the default format
in Bazaar 2.0. Please read the NEWS entry before even thinking about
upgrading to the new format.

Also included are speedups for many operations on huge projects, a bug
fix for pushing stacked new stacked branches to smart servers and the
usual bevy of bug fixes and improvements.

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the bzr adaptive version control system. Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball; packages for
various systems will be available soon.

Changes from 1.16rc1 to 1.16final
*********************************

* Fix the nested tree flag check so that upgrade from development formats to
  2a can work correctly.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #388727)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* Display prompt on stderr (instead of stdout) when querying users so
  that the output of commands can be safely redirected.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #376582)


New Features
************

* A new repository format ``2a`` has been added.  This is a beta release
  of the the brisbane-core (aka group-compress) project.  This format now
  suitable for wider testing by advanced users willing to deal with some
  bugs.  We would appreciate test reports, either positive or negative.
  Format 2a is substantially smaller and faster for many operations on
  many trees.  This format or an updated version will become the default
  in bzr 2.0.

  This is a rich-root format, so this repository format can be used with
  bzr-svn.  Bazaar branches in previous non-rich-root formats can be
  converted (including by merge, push and pull) to format 2a, but not vice
  versa.  We recommend upgrading previous development formats to 2a.

  Upgrading to this format can take considerable time because it expands
  and more concisely repacks the full history.

  If you use stacked branches, you must upgrade the stacked branches
  before the stacked-on branches.  (See
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/374735>)

* ``--development7-rich-root`` is a new dev format, similar to ``--dev6``
  but using a Revision serializer using bencode rather than XML.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)

* mail_client=claws now supports --body (and message body hooks).  Also uses
  configured from address.  (Barry Warsaw)


Improvements
************


* ``--development6-rich-root`` can now stack. (Modulo some smart-server
  bugs with stacking and non default formats.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #373455)

* ``--development6-rich-root`` delays generating a delta index for the
  first object inserted into a group. This has a beneficial impact on
  ``bzr commit`` since each committed texts goes to its own group. For
  committing a 90MB file, it drops peak memory by about 200MB, and speeds
  up commit from 7s => 4s. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Numerous operations are now faster for huge projects, i.e. those
  with a large number of files and/or a large number of revisions,
  particularly when the latest development format is used. These
  operations (and improvements on OpenOffice.org) include:

  * branch in a shared repository (2X faster)
  * branch --no-tree (100X faster)
  * diff (2X faster)
  * tags (70X faster)

  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Pyrex version of ``bencode`` support. This provides optimized support
  for both encoding and decoding, and is now found at ``bzrlib.bencode``.
  ``bzrlib.utils.bencode`` is now deprecated.
  (Alexander Belchenko, Jelmer Vernooij, John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar can now pass attachment files to the mutt email client.
  (Edwin Grubbs, #384158)

* Better message in ``bzr add`` output suggesting using ``bzr ignored`` to
  see which files can also be added.  (Jason Spashett, #76616)

* ``bzr pull -r 123`` from a stacked branch on a smart server no longer fails.
  Also, the ``Branch.revision_history()`` API now works in the same
  situation.  (Andrew Bennetts, #380314)

* ``bzr serve`` on Windows no longer displays a traceback simply because a
  TCP client disconnected. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Clarify the rules for locking and fallback repositories. Fix bugs in how
  ``RemoteRepository`` was handling fallbacks along with the
  ``_real_repository``. (Andrew Bennetts, John Arbash Meinel, #375496)

* Fix a small bug with fetching revisions w/ ghosts into a new stacked
  branch. Not often triggered, because it required ghosts to be part of
  the fetched revisions, not in the stacked-on ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Fix status and commit to work with content filtered trees, addressing
  numerous bad bugs with line-ending support. (Ian Clatworthy, #362030)

* Fix problem of "directory not empty" when contending for a lock over
  sftp.  (Martin Pool, #340352)

* Fix rule handling so that eol is optional, not mandatory.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #379370)

* Pushing a new stacked branch to a 1.15 smart server was broken due to a
  bug in the ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` smart verb.  This is fixed in
  1.16, but required changes to the network protocol, so the
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` verb has been removed and replaced with a
  corrected ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex_1.16`` verb.  1.15 clients will
  still work with a 1.16 server as they will fallback to slower (and
  bug-free) methods.
  (Jonathan Lange, Robert Collins, Andrew Bennetts, #385132)

* Reconcile can now deal with text revisions that originated in revisions
  that are ghosts. (Jelmer Vernooij, #336749)

* Support cloning of branches with ghosts in the left hand side history.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #248540)

* The ''bzr diff'' now catches OSError from osutils.rmtree and logs a
  helpful message to the trace file, unless the temp directory really was
  removed (which would be very strange).  Since the diff operation has
  succeeded from the user's perspective, no output is written to stderr
  or stdout.  (Maritza Mendez, #363837)

* Translate errors received from a smart server in response to a
  ``BzrDirFormat.initialize`` or ``BzrDirFormat.initialize_ex`` request.
  This was causing tracebacks even for mundane errors like
  ``PermissionDenied``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #381329)

Documentation
*************

* Added directory structure and started translation of docs in Russian.
  (Alexey Shtokalo, Alexander Iljin, Alexander Belchenko, Dmitry Vasiliev,
  Volodymyr Kotulskyi)


API Changes
***********

* Added osutils.parent_directories(). (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzrlib.progress.ProgressBar``, ``ChildProgress``, ``DotsProgressBar``,
  ``TTYProgressBar`` and ``child_progress`` are now deprecated; use
  ``ui_factory.nested_progress_bar`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``graph.StackedParentsProvider`` is now a public API, replacing
  ``graph._StackedParentsProvider``. The api is now considered stable and ready
  for external users. (Gary van der Merwe)

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is deprecated in favor of
  ``get_user_encoding``.  (Alexander Belchenko)

* TreeTransformBase no longer assumes that limbo is provided via disk.
  DiskTreeTransform now provides disk functionality.  (Aaron Bentley)

Internals
*********

* Remove ``weave.py`` script for accessing internals of old weave-format
  repositories.  (Martin Pool)

Testing
*******

* The number of cores is now correctly detected on OSX. (John Szakmeister)

* The number of cores is also detected on Solaris and win32. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* The number of cores is also detected on FreeBSD. (Matthew Fuller)

We discovered a couple of bugs in the 1.16 release that we simply had
to fix now. As such...

The Bazaar team is mostly happy & just a little bit embarrassed to
announce availability of a new release of the bzr adaptive version
control system. Bazaar is part of the GNU system <http://gnu.org/>.

End user testing of the 2a format revealed two serious bugs. The
first, #365615, caused bzr to raise AbsentContentFactory errors when
autopacking. This meant that commits or pushes to 2a-format
repositories failed intermittently.

The second bug, #390563, caused the smart server to raise
AbsentContentFactory when streaming 2a stacked 2a-format branches.
This particularly affected branches stored on Launchpad in the 2a
format.

Both of these bugs cause command failures only, neither of them cause
data corruption or data loss. And, of course, both of these bugs are
now fixed.

Thanks in particular to Robert Collins and John Arbash Meinel for
fixing these bugs.

Bazaar is now available for download from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball; packages for
various systems will be available soon.

Bug Fixes
*********

* We now properly request a more minimal set of file texts when fetching
  multiple revisions. (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* Repositories using CHK pages (which includes the new 2a format) will no
  longer error during commit or push operations when an autopack operation
  is triggered. (Robert Collins, #365615)

* ``chk_map.iter_interesting_nodes`` now properly uses the *intersection*
  of referenced nodes rather than the *union* to determine what
  uninteresting pages we still need to look at. Prior to this,
  incrementally pushing to stacked branch would push the minimal data, but
  fetching everything would request extra texts. There are some unhandled
  cases wrt trees of different depths, but this fixes the common cases.
  (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #390563)

* ``GroupCompress`` repositories now take advantage of the pack hints
  parameter to permit cross-format fetching to incrementally pack the
  converted data. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.commit_write_group`` now returns opaque data about what
  was committed, for passing to the ``Repository.pack``. Repositories
  without atomic commits will still return None. (Robert Collins)

* ``Repository.pack`` now takes an optional ``hint`` parameter
  which will support doing partial packs for repositories that can do
  that. (Robert Collins)

* RepositoryFormat has a new attribute 'pack_compresses' which is True
  when doing a pack operation changes the compression of content in the
  repository. (Robert Collins)

* ``StreamSink`` and ``InterDifferingSerialiser`` will call
  ``Repository.pack`` with the hint returned by
  ``Repository.commit_write_group`` if the formats were different and the
  repository can increase compression by doing a pack operation.
  (Robert Collins, #376748)

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm thrilled to announce
our 0.4 release. Just 8 days after our first public release, 0.4 is the
first release with foreign language translations including French,
Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish!

Numerous bugs have been fixed and several new features have been added.
These include:

* launching of your editor, file manager and tree browser (qbrowse) from
  the working tree panel

* easier management of branches in a repository - a details panel
  shows recent history, unique revisions and missing revisions
  for the selected branch

* editor and per-file diff launching from the branch/checkout status
  report

* a welcome page

* initial Launchpad integration.

For downloads and more detailed release notes, see
https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.4. If not already there,
a Windows installer will be added to that page real soon now.

Thanks to everyone who installed 0.3 and provided feedback. We hope you
like 0.4 even more!

Ian C.

On behalf of QBzr developers I'd like to announce release of QBzr 0.12.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
Maintenance release: compatibility with bzr 1.17 (progress indicator for
commands); branching into exisiting directory (with qbranch) works now
(require bzr 1.17); better support of unicode paths in various commands.

 * qbranch: now it's possible to branch into newly created empty directory.
 * qgetupdates: new alias: qgetup
 * qmerge: the revision argument is no longer ignored.
 * qupdate: new command as simple front-end for stadard `bzr update`
 * qversion: new command to display Bazaar & Python installation information
 * qannotate:
   * Revisions are loaded lazily (only when they appear on screen.) This
     greatly reduces the load time when annotating a file from a remote branch.
     (The code for this is reused from qlog.)
   * Add a item to the revision list context menu to annotate a older revision.
 * qbrowse:
   * It is now possible to browse a working tree. The change status of file is
     shown.
   * Trees are loaded lazily (sub directories are only loaded when you expand
     them.)
   * Revisions are loaded lazily (only when they appear on screen.) This
     greatly reduces the load time when browseing a remote branch.
     (The code for this is reused from qlog.)
 * qlog/qannotate/qbrowse: revision numbers are right aligned on the mainline
                           number. E.g:

                           10
                            9
                            8.2
                            8.1
                            8
 * Universal installer for Windows: one installer for both standalone bzr.exe
   version and for python-based version.

NOTES: this is last release with tested PyQt 4.3.x support.
All further releases will be tested against PyQt 4.4 as minimum supported
version.

Bazaar continues to blaze a straight and shining path to the 2.0 release an=
d
the elevation of the ``2a`` beta format to the full glory of "supported and
stable".

Highlights in this release include greatly reduced memory consumption durin=
g
commits, faster ``ls``, faster ``annotate``, faster network operations if
you're specifying a revision number and the final destruction of those
annoying progress bar artifacts.

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the bzr adaptive version control system. Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball; packages for
various systems will be available soon.

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* ``bzr register-branch`` from the Launchpad plugin now refers to "project"
  instead of "product" which is the correct Launchpad terminology.  The
  --product option is deprecated and users should switch to using --project=
.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #238764)


New Features
************

* ``bzr push`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree (if one is present) and no revision is
  speified. The configuration option ``push_strict`` can be used to set the
  default for this behavior.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #284038, #322808, #65286)

* ``bzr revno`` and ``bzr revision-info`` now have a ``--tree`` option to
  show revision info for the working tree instead of the branch.
  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr send`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree and no revision is specified. The
  configuration option ``send_strict`` can be used to set the default for t=
his
  behavior.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #206577)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Accept uppercase "Y/N" to prompts such as from break lock.
  (#335182, Tim Powell, Martin Pool)

* Add documentation about diverged branches and how to fix them in the
  centralized workflow with local commits.  Mention ``bzr help
  diverged-branches`` when a push fails because the branches have
  diverged.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #269477)

* Annotate would sometimes 'latch on' to trivial lines, causing important
  lines to be incorrectly annotated. (John Arbash Meinel, #387952)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)

* Avoid progress bar artifacts being left behind on the screen.
  (Martin Pool, #321935)

* Better message in ``bzr split`` error suggesting a rich root format.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #220067)

* ``Branch.set_append_revisions_only`` now works with branches on a smart
  server. (Andrew Bennetts, #365865)

* By default, ``bzr branch`` will fail if the target directory exists, but
  does not already have a control directory.  The flag ``--use-existing-dir=
``
  will allow operation to proceed.  (Alexander Belchenko, #307554)

* ``bzr ls DIR --from-root`` now shows only things in DIR, not everything.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fetch between repositories does not error if they have inconsistent data
  that should be irrelevant to the fetch operation. (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix ``AttributeError`` exception when reconfiguring lightweight checkout
  of a remote repository.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #332194)

* Fix bug in decoding v3 smart server messages when receiving multiple
  lots of excess bytes after an end-of-message.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Force deletion of readonly files during merge, update and other tree
  transforms.
  (Craig Hewetson, Martin Pool, #218206)

* Force socket shutdown in threaded http test servers to avoid client hangs
  (pycurl).  (Vincent Ladeuil, #383920).

* ``LRUCache`` will maintain the linked list pointers even if a nodes
  cleanup function raises an exception. (John Arbash Meinel, #396838)

* Progress bars are now suppressed again when the environment variable
  ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` is set to ``none``.
  (Martin Pool, #339385)

* Reduced memory consumption during ``bzr commit`` of large files. For
  pre 2a formats, should be down to ~3x the size of a file.
  For ``--2a`` format repositories, it is down to the size of the file
  content plus the size of the compressed text.  Related to bug #109114.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Set hidden attribute on .bzr directory below unicode path should never
  fail with error. The operation should succeed even if bzr unable to set
  the attribute.  (Alexander Belchenko, related to bug #335362).

* Stacking will no longer accept requests to stack on the same
  branch/repository. Existing branches that incorrectly reference the same
  repository in a stacking configuration will now raise
  UnstackableLocationError when the branch is opened. This can be fixed by
  removing the stacking location inside ``.bzr/branch``.
  (Robert Collins, #376243)

* The ``log+`` decorator, useful in debugging or profiling, could cause
  "AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'next'".  This is now
  fixed.  The log decorator no longer shows the elapsed time or transfer
  rate because they're available in the log prefixes and the transport
  activity display respectively.
  (Martin Pool, #340347)

* Unshelve works correctly when multiple zero-length files are present on
  the shelf. (Aaron Bentley, #363444)

* Progress bars no longer show the network transport scheme or direction.
  (Martin Pool)

* launchpad-login now respects the 'verbose' option.
  (Jonathan Lange, #217031)


Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is now officially deprecated. It is not
  possible to write a deprecation wrapper, but the variable will be
  removed in the near future. Use ``bzrlib.osutils.get_user_encoding()``
  instead. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Command lookup has had hooks added. ``bzrlib.Command.hooks`` has
  three new hook points: ``get_command``, ``get_missing_command`` and
  ``list_commands``, which allow just-in-time command name provision
  rather than requiring all command names be known a-priori.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``get_app_path`` from win32utils.py now supports REG_EXPAND_SZ data type
  and can read path to wordpad.exe. (Alexander Belchenko, #392046)

* ``graph.KnownGraph`` has been added. This is a class that can give
  answers to ``heads()`` very quickly. However, it has the assumption that
  the whole graph has already been loaded. This is true during
  ``annotate`` so it is used there with good success (as much as 2x faster
  for files with long ancestry and 'cherrypicked' changes.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* OS file locks are now taken out using ``CreateFile`` rather than
  ``LockFileEx`` on Windows. The locking remains exclusive with
  ``LockFileEx`` but now it also works on older versions of Windows (such
  as Win98). (Martin <gzlist>)

* pack <=3D> pack fetching is now done via a ``PackStreamSource`` rather
  than the ``Packer`` code. The user visible change is that we now
  properly fetch the minimum number of texts for non-smart fetching.
  (John Arbash Meinel)


* ``VersionedFiles._add_text`` is a new api that lets us insert text into
  the repository as a single string, rather than a list of lines. This can
  improve memory overhead and performance of committing large files.
  (Currently a private api, used only by commit). (John Arbash Meinel)


Improvements
************

* ``bzr annotate`` can now be significantly faster. The time for
  ``bzr annotate NEWS`` is down to 7s from 22s in 1.16. Files with long
  histories and lots of 'duplicate insertions' will be improved more than
  others. (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr ls`` is now faster. On OpenOffice.org, the time drops from 2.4
  to 1.1 seconds. The improvement for ``bzr ls -r-1`` is more
  substantial dropping from 54.3 to 1.1 seconds. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Improve "Path(s) are not versioned" error reporting for some commands.
  (Beno=EEt PIERRE)

* Initial commit performance in ``--2a`` repositories has been improved by
  making it cheaper to build the initial CHKMap. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Resolving a revno to a revision id on a branch accessed via ``bzr://``
  or ``bzr+ssh://`` is now much faster and involves no VFS operations.
  This speeds up commands like ``bzr pull -r 123``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``revision-info`` now properly aligns the revnos/revids in the output
  and doesn't traceback when given revisions not in the current branch.
  Performance is also significantly improved when requesting multiple revs
  at once.  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* Tildes are no longer escaped by Transports. (Andy Kilner)


Documentation
*************

* Avoid bad text wrapping in generated documentation.  Slightly better
  formatting in the user reference.
  (Martin Pool, #249908)

* Minor clarifications to the help for End-Of-Line conversions.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* Removed overspecific error class ``InvalidProgressBarType``.
  (Martin Pool)

* The method ``ProgressView._show_transport_activity`` is now
  ``show_transport_activity`` because it's part of the contract between
  this class and the UI.  (Martin Pool)

Bazaar continues to blaze a straight and shining path to the 2.0 release an=
d
the elevation of the ``2a`` beta format to the full glory of "supported and
stable".

Highlights in this release include greatly reduced memory consumption durin=
g
commits, faster ``ls``, faster ``annotate``, faster network operations if
you're specifying a revision number and the final destruction of those
annoying progress bar artifacts.

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the bzr adaptive version control system. Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download as a source tarball; packages for
various systems will be available soon.

Changes from 1.17rc1 to 1.17final
*********************************

* Change an extension to call the python ``frozenset()`` rather than the C
  api ``PyFrozenSet_New``. It turns out that python2.4 did not expose the
  C api. (John Arbash Meinel, #399366)

* Fixes for the Makefile and the rename of ``generate_docs.py`` to
  ``tools/generate_docs.py`` to allow everything to be built on Windows.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #399356)

* ``bzr serve`` once again applies a ``ChrootServer`` to the given
  directory before serving it. (Andrew Bennetts, #400535)


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* ``bzr register-branch`` from the Launchpad plugin now refers to "project"
  instead of "product" which is the correct Launchpad terminology.  The
  --product option is deprecated and users should switch to using --project=
.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #238764)


New Features
************

* ``bzr push`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree (if one is present) and no revision is
  speified. The configuration option ``push_strict`` can be used to set the
  default for this behavior.  (Vincent Ladeuil, #284038, #322808, #65286)

* ``bzr revno`` and ``bzr revision-info`` now have a ``--tree`` option to
  show revision info for the working tree instead of the branch.
  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr send`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree and no revision is specified. The
  configuration option ``send_strict`` can be used to set the default for t=
his
  behavior.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #206577)

* ``bzr switch --create-branch/-b`` can now be used to create and switch
  to a new branch. Supplying a name without a ``/`` will create the branch
  relative to the existing branch. (similar to how ``bzr switch name``
  works when the branch already exists.) (John Arbash Meinel)


Bug Fixes
*********

* Accept uppercase "Y/N" to prompts such as from break lock.
  (#335182, Tim Powell, Martin Pool)

* Add documentation about diverged branches and how to fix them in the
  centralized workflow with local commits.  Mention ``bzr help
  diverged-branches`` when a push fails because the branches have
  diverged.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #269477)

* Annotate would sometimes 'latch on' to trivial lines, causing important
  lines to be incorrectly annotated. (John Arbash Meinel, #387952)

* Automatic format upgrades triggered by default stacking policies on a
  1.16rc1 (or later) smart server work again.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #388675)

* Avoid progress bar artifacts being left behind on the screen.
  (Martin Pool, #321935)

* Better message in ``bzr split`` error suggesting a rich root format.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #220067)

* ``Branch.set_append_revisions_only`` now works with branches on a smart
  server. (Andrew Bennetts, #365865)

* By default, ``bzr branch`` will fail if the target directory exists, but
  does not already have a control directory.  The flag ``--use-existing-dir=
``
  will allow operation to proceed.  (Alexander Belchenko, #307554)

* ``bzr ls DIR --from-root`` now shows only things in DIR, not everything.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

* Fetch between repositories does not error if they have inconsistent data
  that should be irrelevant to the fetch operation. (Aaron Bentley)

* Fix ``AttributeError`` exception when reconfiguring lightweight checkout
  of a remote repository.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #332194)

* Fix bug in decoding v3 smart server messages when receiving multiple
  lots of excess bytes after an end-of-message.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Force deletion of readonly files during merge, update and other tree
  transforms.
  (Craig Hewetson, Martin Pool, #218206)

* Force socket shutdown in threaded http test servers to avoid client hangs
  (pycurl).  (Vincent Ladeuil, #383920).

* ``LRUCache`` will maintain the linked list pointers even if a nodes
  cleanup function raises an exception. (John Arbash Meinel, #396838)

* Progress bars are now suppressed again when the environment variable
  ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` is set to ``none``.
  (Martin Pool, #339385)

* Reduced memory consumption during ``bzr commit`` of large files. For
  pre 2a formats, should be down to ~3x the size of a file.
  For ``--2a`` format repositories, it is down to the size of the file
  content plus the size of the compressed text.  Related to bug #109114.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Set hidden attribute on .bzr directory below unicode path should never
  fail with error. The operation should succeed even if bzr unable to set
  the attribute.  (Alexander Belchenko, related to bug #335362).

* Stacking will no longer accept requests to stack on the same
  branch/repository. Existing branches that incorrectly reference the same
  repository in a stacking configuration will now raise
  UnstackableLocationError when the branch is opened. This can be fixed by
  removing the stacking location inside ``.bzr/branch``.
  (Robert Collins, #376243)

* The ``log+`` decorator, useful in debugging or profiling, could cause
  "AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'next'".  This is now
  fixed.  The log decorator no longer shows the elapsed time or transfer
  rate because they're available in the log prefixes and the transport
  activity display respectively.
  (Martin Pool, #340347)

* Unshelve works correctly when multiple zero-length files are present on
  the shelf. (Aaron Bentley, #363444)

* Progress bars no longer show the network transport scheme or direction.
  (Martin Pool)

* launchpad-login now respects the 'verbose' option.
  (Jonathan Lange, #217031)


Internals
*********

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` is now officially deprecated. It is not
  possible to write a deprecation wrapper, but the variable will be
  removed in the near future. Use ``bzrlib.osutils.get_user_encoding()``
  instead. (Alexander Belchenko)

* Command lookup has had hooks added. ``bzrlib.Command.hooks`` has
  three new hook points: ``get_command``, ``get_missing_command`` and
  ``list_commands``, which allow just-in-time command name provision
  rather than requiring all command names be known a-priori.
  (Robert Collins)

* ``get_app_path`` from win32utils.py now supports REG_EXPAND_SZ data type
  and can read path to wordpad.exe. (Alexander Belchenko, #392046)

* ``graph.KnownGraph`` has been added. This is a class that can give
  answers to ``heads()`` very quickly. However, it has the assumption that
  the whole graph has already been loaded. This is true during
  ``annotate`` so it is used there with good success (as much as 2x faster
  for files with long ancestry and 'cherrypicked' changes.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* OS file locks are now taken out using ``CreateFile`` rather than
  ``LockFileEx`` on Windows. The locking remains exclusive with
  ``LockFileEx`` but now it also works on older versions of Windows (such
  as Win98). (Martin <gzlist>)

* pack <=3D> pack fetching is now done via a ``PackStreamSource`` rather
  than the ``Packer`` code. The user visible change is that we now
  properly fetch the minimum number of texts for non-smart fetching.
  (John Arbash Meinel)


* ``VersionedFiles._add_text`` is a new api that lets us insert text into
  the repository as a single string, rather than a list of lines. This can
  improve memory overhead and performance of committing large files.
  (Currently a private api, used only by commit). (John Arbash Meinel)


Improvements
************

* ``bzr annotate`` can now be significantly faster. The time for
  ``bzr annotate NEWS`` is down to 7s from 22s in 1.16. Files with long
  histories and lots of 'duplicate insertions' will be improved more than
  others. (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``bzr ls`` is now faster. On OpenOffice.org, the time drops from 2.4
  to 1.1 seconds. The improvement for ``bzr ls -r-1`` is more
  substantial dropping from 54.3 to 1.1 seconds. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Improve "Path(s) are not versioned" error reporting for some commands.
  (Beno=EEt PIERRE)

* Initial commit performance in ``--2a`` repositories has been improved by
  making it cheaper to build the initial CHKMap. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Resolving a revno to a revision id on a branch accessed via ``bzr://``
  or ``bzr+ssh://`` is now much faster and involves no VFS operations.
  This speeds up commands like ``bzr pull -r 123``.  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``revision-info`` now properly aligns the revnos/revids in the output
  and doesn't traceback when given revisions not in the current branch.
  Performance is also significantly improved when requesting multiple revs
  at once.  (Matthew Fuller, John Arbash Meinel)

* Tildes are no longer escaped by Transports. (Andy Kilner)


Documentation
*************

* Avoid bad text wrapping in generated documentation.  Slightly better
  formatting in the user reference.
  (Martin Pool, #249908)

* Minor clarifications to the help for End-Of-Line conversions.
  (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* Removed overspecific error class ``InvalidProgressBarType``.
  (Martin Pool)

* The method ``ProgressView._show_transport_activity`` is now
  ``show_transport_activity`` because it's part of the contract between
  this class and the UI.  (Martin Pool)

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm pleased to announce our
0.5 release. Bazaar Explorer runs on GNOME, KDE, Windows and Mac OS X.
It requires Bazaar 1.14 or later and QBzr 0.11 or later.

Based on feedback from early adopters, the 0.5 release includes many
usability improvements and numerous bug fixes. For downloads and release
notes, see https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.5. If not
already there, a Windows installer will be added to that page soon.

Ian C.

Bazaar Explorer 0.5 Release Notes
=================================

General UI improvements:

* To simplify the UI for new users starting with the Solo workflow,
  the collaborate actions (pull/merge/update/push/send) are now a
  submenu on the toolbar instead of separate actions.

* Working tree browser hidden when not applicable, e.g. when showing
  Welcome page.

* If a page is opened a second time, switch to the already opened
  one rather than create a new one.

* The Bazaar menu has been tweaked with the Tags action now on the
  Collaborate submenu. The unimplemented Rename and Delete actions
  have also been removed from the Work submenu as these are more
  likely to be accessed in other ways (e.g. the Working Tree
  browser) once implemented.

* The Settings menu has been re-organised given ignores are actually
  working-tree-specific, not branch-specific. (The difference becomes
  important if you have multiple checkouts switched to the same
  branch.)

Status report improvements:

* Added a "What's next?" section providing state-sensitive workflow
  hints.

* Included the tip (last revision) number in status report summary.

* Add action links to section headers, e.g. add for unversioned,
  log for pending merge tips, conflicts for conflicts.

* Clicking on a text conflict now launches the text editor.

* Add delete action link for unversioned items.

Working tree browser improvements:

* Double-click now opens a file using the default application instead
  of always opening the text editor.

Repository view improvements:

* More interesting locations within a repository (e.g. trunk, work)
  are placed first.

* Rename Unique Revisions tab to Local Changes,
  include the one line summary of working tree status and
  improve the wording w.r.t. unique revisions.

* Improved wording on the Missing Revisions tab.

* Added Manage, Branch and Open buttons. If an item is selected,
  the Manage action opens it in your file manager, otherwise it
  opens the repository. If a branch or bound branch is selected,
  the Branch action uses it as the default source.

Added an experimental mode previewing pending features:

* A "Branch Changes" view showing the equivalent of
  "bzr status -rsubmit:..-1", i.e. previewing what "bzr send"
  would put into a bundle.

Bug fixes:

* Refresh on the repository view now refreshes the details panel.

* Numerous others.

Translations:

* Added German and Turkish translations.

Hi all,

A dedicated bzr-windows team and mailing list has now been created. This
forum is designed for community members interested in discussing,
enhancing, testing and supporting Bazaar on Windows. To join, visit
https://launchpad.net/~bzr-windows/+join and sign up.

For good Windows developers keen to make an impact, the next few weeks
are a particularly great time to get involved. With bzr 2.0 and Bazaar
Explorer 1.0 both planned for release several weeks from now, we have a
real opportunity to bring better version control to the masses. We can't
do it without more involvement from our Windows users though - we really
and truly need your input!

NOTE: You do *not* need to be a bzr developer to join this team, just
interested in making the user experience on Windows a better one.

Keen? https://launchpad.net/~bzr-windows/+join is the link to visit.

Thanks for listening,
Ian C.

PS: The standalone Windows installer for 1.13 has received 36,000
downloads, so even small changes in coming weeks will benefit many.

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm pleased to announce our
0.6.1 release. Bazaar Explorer runs on GNOME, KDE, Windows and Mac OS X.
It requires Bazaar 1.14 or later and QBzr 0.11 or later, though QBzr
0.13.1 is recommended for the best experience.

This release provides access to the new qsend and qswitch dialogs for
emailing changes and switching checkouts respectively. It also
introduces a Preferences/Options dialog for easy switching between QBzr
and Bzr-GTK applets. Some limited support for configuring the toolbar is
also provided and user input is welcome on what more should be offered
in this regard. (For example, we'd like to offer toolbars optimised for
various workflow models, particularly the Centralised workflow, so let
us know what you want here please via raising a "wishlist" bug say.)

For downloads and more detailed release notes, see
https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.6.1

Ian C.

Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

We haven't closed all the bugs related to doing a 2.0 release yet, but
bug 398668 has just been closed: the default format for bzr is now 2a.

This will have immediate ramifications for users of bzr trunk - either
nightly builds or direct from source. If you don't use bzr nightlies or
trunk, then you can ignore this email.

In particular, when creating a new shared repo via 'bzr init-repo', the
repository that is created will be in '2a' format rather than
'pack-0.92'. If the project you are going to be working with hasn't
upgraded yet, you may need to either create an older format repository
by hand, or get the project to upgrade.

I encourage you to read our upgrade guide for more details.
http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.1.18rc1-html/en/upgrade-guide/index.html=20

Cheers,
Rob

On behalf of the QBzr developers team, I'm happy to announce the shining 
new 0.14 release of QBzr, code-named "Eucalyptus"!

The main reason for releasing 0.14 so quickly after 0.13.1 is the desire 
to get it included into the next Ubuntu release, "Karmic Koala". We'll 
gratefully accept any help anyone can offer to achieve this goal ;-)

Despite a short development cycle, this release incorporates a lot of 
improvements, in particular 5 new q-dialogs, and many other improvements 
and bug fixes.

What is QBzr?
-------------
QBzr is a cross platform, Qt-based front-end for Bazaar, providing GUI 
applications for many core bzr commands. In addition, it provides 
several special dialogs and helper commands. Equivalents for core bzr 
commands have the same names as CLI commands but with a prefix of "q". 
Today QBzr 0.14 provides 30 user commands, 24 of them based on core 
commands. QBzr works smoothly on all major platforms with Qt/PyQt 4.4.x 
or later.

Note: QBzr's applications are the core "GUI dialogs" in several major 
Bazaar projects including:

  * Bazaar Explorer
  * QBzr-Eclipse
  * TortoiseBzr (Windows only)

So all testing, bug fixing and improvements made to QBzr benefits all of 
these projects. To help with any of these, please visit QBzr on 
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/qbzr.

Download
--------
Sources tarball:
   http://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.14/+download/qbzr-0.14.tar.gz

Universal installer for Windows users (suitable to use with both 
standalone and python-based installers):
   http://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.14/+download/qbzr-setup-0.14.exe

PPA for Ubuntu users:
   https://launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/+archive/ppa

Release branch:
   https://code.launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/qbzr/0.14

What's new in this release
--------------------------
  * we have 5 new dialogs (qbind, qunbind, qexport, qplugins and quncommit).
  * better help for plugin itself (now `bzr help qbzr` gives you
    useful info).
  * qcommit and uncommit hook now can store revision message and
    information about bugfixes for revision, this information automatically
    restored on next qcommit run in this branch.
  * most q-commands now able to return exit code 0 when operation
    finished successfully, and exit code 1 when dialog/operation was 
canceled.
  * `merge --qpreview` feature has disabled.
  * qmerge now supports uncommitted and forced merging.
  * Dozen bugfixes and small improvements.

For a detailed changelog, see the release page:
https://launchpad.net/qbzr/trunk/0.14

Special note
------------
As I've mentioned we really want to put this release into Ubuntu Karmic.

Sure - I'll do that later.

IMPORTANT: Right now, there is *no* bzr-explorer package in karmic. It
would be greatly appreciated if someone could volunteer to change this
by packaging and uploading 0.7. Now for the announcement itself ...

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm pleased to announce our
0.7 release, ready for uploading into karmic! This release is designed
to work with (the pending) Bazaar 2.0beta1 and (the recently released)
QBzr 0.14, though it should continue to work with Bazaar 1.14 or later
and QBzr 0.11 or later.

This release provides access to the many new dialogs in QBzr 0.14:
quncommit, qexport, qplugins, qbind and qunbind. It also contains
numerous bug fixes and UI improvements. In particular, the behavior of
menus on the tool-bar is now more consistent as several people had found
the old design unintuitive.

Note: After qswitch, qbind and qunbind, Explorer's Refresh action isn't
working as well as it needs to yet. This bug (#417904) will be fixed in
0.8. Better still, I'm hoping the need for an explicit refresh after
these actions will disappear altogether! In the meantime, the workaround
is to close the page and open it again.

For downloads and more detailed release notes, see
https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.7.

Enjoy,
Ian C.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 2.0.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 2.0.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
None.  It's slightly surreal to be releasing a 2.0.0 with no substantial
changes, but I guess that's what you get from tying release numbers to
the larger project.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 2.0.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.0.0/+download/bzrtools-2.0.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.0.0/+download/bzrtools-2.0.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the Bazaar adaptive version control system.  Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and
feedback.

Source and binaries are now available from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download> and the changes since the last release
are summarized below.

bzr 1.18
########

:Codename: little traveller
:1.18:    2009-08-20
:1.18rc1: 2009-08-10

This release of Bazaar marches on towards the 2.0 release in which the 2a
'brisbane-core' format becomes generally recommended.  Most of the work in
this release now focusses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering both 2a
and previous formats.  There is a new text-mode interactive merge feature,
a new guide to migration to 2a format in the user documentation, and
pushing branches to a smart server is now much faster. =20

The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long-term supported release,
with bugfix-only releases based on it continuing for at least six months
or until the following stable release.

There are no changes from 1.18rc1 to 1.18.

New Features
************

* ``bzr merge --interactive`` applies a user-selected portion of the
  merge.  The UI is similar to ``shelve``.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr reconfigure`` now takes options ``--stacked-on URL`` and
  ``--unstacked`` to change stacking of a branch.
  (Martin Pool, #391411)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Annotating on a stacked branch will now succeed in simple scenarios.
  There are still some complex scenarios where it will fail (bug #399884)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393366)

* A progress bar is no longer left dangling when ``bzr selftest``
  completes, and the progress bar updates with zero latency so the
  displayed test name is always the one that's actually running.
  (Martin Pool, #123688)

* Authenticating against an ssh server now uses ``auth_none`` to determine
  if password authentication is even supported. This fixes a bug where
  users would be prompted for a launchpad password, even though launchpad
  only supports publickey authentication. (John Arbash Meinel, #375867)

* BranchBuilder now accepts timezone to avoid test failures in countries far
  from GMT. (Vincent Ladeuil, #397716)

* ``bzr commit`` no longer saves the unversioning of missing files until
  the commit has completed on the branch. This means that aborting a
  commit that found a missing file will leave the tree unedited.
  (Robert Collins, #282402)

* ``bzr mv`` no longer takes out branch locks, which allows it to work
  when the branch is readonly. (Robert Collins, #216541)

* ``bzr revert .`` no longer generates an InconsistentDelta error when
  there are missing subtrees. (Robert Collins, #367632)

* ``bzr send`` now generates valid bundles with ``--2a`` formats. However,
  do to internal changes necessary to support this, older clients will
  fail when trying to insert them. For newer clients, the bundle can be
  used to apply the changes to any rich-root compatible format.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393349)

* Cope with FTP servers that don't support restart/append by falling back
  to reading and then rewriting the whole file, such as TahoeLAFS.  (This
  fallback may be slow for some access patterns.)  (Nils Durner, #294709)

* Encode the paths in ``mbcs`` encoding on Windows when spawning an
  external diff client. This at least allows supporting filenames that are
  not ascii, but are present in the current locale. Ideally we would be
  able to pass the Unicode path, but that would be client dependent.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #382709)

* Fix a compile bug on Solaris having to do with const and
  pointer-to-pointers. (John Arbash Meinel, #408441)

* Fixed a NameError that occurs when merging or pulling from a URL that
  causes a redirection loop when bzr tries to read a URL as a bundle.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #400847)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'TestUIFactory' object has no attribute 'tick'``
  running send and similar commands on 2a formats.
  (Martin Pool, #408201)
 =20
* Fixed export to existing directory: if directory is empty then export=20
  will succeed, otherwise it fails with error.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #406174)

* Fixed spurious "Source branch does not support stacking" warning when
  pushing. (Andrew Bennetts, #388908)

* Fixed spurious transport activity indicator appearing while tests are
  running.  (Martin Pool, #343532)

* Merge now correctly handles empty right-hand revision specs.
  (Aaron Bentley, #333961)

* Renames to lexographically lower basenames in trees that have never been
  committed to will no longer corrupt the dirstate. This was caused by an
  bug in the dirstate update_minimal method. (Robert Collins, #395556)

* Requests for unknown methods no longer cause the smart server to log
  lots of backtraces about ``UnknownSmartMethod``, ``do_chunk`` or
  ``do_end``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #338561)
 =20
* Streaming from bzr servers where there is a chain of stacked branches
  (A stacked on B stacked on C) will now work. (Robert Collins, #406597)

* The environment variable ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` set to either ``text`` or `=
`none``
  always forces progress bars either on or off respectively.  Otherwise,
  they're turned on if ``TERM`` is not ``dumb`` and stderr is a terminal.
  bzr always uses the 'text' user interface when run as a command, so
  ``BZR_USE_TEXT_UI`` is no longer needed.
  (Martin Pool, #339385, #387717)

* The optional ``_knit_load_data_pyx`` C extension was never being
  imported.  This caused significant slowdowns when reading data from
  repositories.  (Andrew Bennetts, #405653)
 =20
* The ``--hardlink`` option to ``branch`` and ``checkout`` is not
  supported at the moment on workingtree formats that can do content
  filtering.  (See <https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/408193>.)
  bzr now says so, rather than just ignoring the option.  (Martin Pool)

* There was a bug in ``osutils.relpath`` that was only triggered on
  Windows. Essentially if you were at the root of a drive, and did
  something to a branch/repo on another drive, we would go into an
  infinite loop while trying to find a 'relative path'.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #394227)

* ``WorkingTree4.unversion`` will no longer fail to unversion ids which
  were present in a parent tree but renamed in the working tree.
  (Robert Collins, #187207)

Improvements
************

* Can now rename/move files even if they have been removed from the invento=
ry.
  (Marius Kruger)

* Pushing branches with tags via ``bzr://`` and ``bzr+ssh://`` is much
  faster, using a new ``Branch.set_tags_bytes`` smart server verb rather
  than VFS methods.  For example, pushes of small branches with tags take
  11 rather than 18 smart server requests.  (Andrew Bennetts, #398608)

* Sending Ctrl-Break on Windows will now drop you into the debugger, in
  the same way that sending Ctrl-\\ does on other platforms.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Documentation
*************

* Added Bazaar 2.0 Upgrade Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* ``CLIUIFactory`` is deprecated; use ``TextUIFactory`` instead if you
  need to subclass or create a specific class, or better yet the existing
  ``make_ui_for_terminal``.  ``SilentUIFactory`` is clarified to do no
  user interaction at all, rather than trying to read from stdin but not
  writing any output, which would be strange if reading prompts or
  passwords.  (Martin Pool)

* New TransformPreview.commit() allows committing without a working tree.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``pb`` parameter to ``TextTestResult`` is deprecated and ignored.
  (Martin Pool)

* ProgressTasks now prefer to talk direct to their ProgressView not to the
  UIFactory.=20
  (Martin Pool)

* ``WorkingTree._check`` now requires a references dict with keys matching
  those returned by ``WorkingTree._get_check_refs``. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``CHKInventory.path2id`` uses the parent_id to basename hash to avoid
  reading the entries along the path, reducing work to lookup ids from
  paths. (Robert Collins)

* ``CHKMap.apply_delta`` now raises ``InconsistentDelta`` if a delta adds
  as new a key which was already mapped. (Robert Collins)

* Inventory delta application catches more cases of corruption and can
  prevent corrupt deltas from affecting consistency of data structures on
  disk. (Robert Collins)

* --subunit support now adds timestamps if the subunit version supports
  it. (Robert Collins)

* The Windows all-in-one installer now bundles the PyQt image format
  plugins, which allows previewing more images as part of 'qdiff'.
  (Alexander Belchenko)


Testing
*******

* Merge directive cherrypick tests must use the same root id.
  (Martin Pool, #409684)

* Spurious failure in ``check`` tests on rich-root formats fixed.
  (Martin Pool, #408199)

* The ``bzrlib.tests.TextTestRunner`` will no longer call
  ``countTestsCases`` on the test being run. Progress information is
  instead handled by having the test passed in call ``result.progress``
  before running its contents. This improves the behaviour when using
  ``TextTestRunner`` with test suites that don't support
  ``countTestsCases``. (Robert Collins)

On behalf of the QBzr developers team, I'm happy to announce the
maintenance release of QBzr 0.14.1.

What is QBzr?
-------------
QBzr is a cross platform, Qt-based front-end for Bazaar, providing GUI
applications for many core bzr commands. In addition, it provides
several special dialogs and helper commands. Equivalents for core bzr
commands have the same names as CLI commands but with a prefix of "q".
Today QBzr 0.14 provides 30 user commands, 24 of them based on core
commands. QBzr works smoothly on all major platforms with Qt/PyQt
4.4.x or later.

Note: QBzr's applications are the core "GUI dialogs" in several major
Bazaar projects including:

=A0* Bazaar Explorer
=A0* QBzr-Eclipse
=A0* TortoiseBzr (Windows only)

So all testing, bug fixing and improvements made to QBzr benefits all
of these projects. To help with any of these, please visit QBzr on
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/qbzr.

The documentation for 2.0rc2 is now built and available online. To
browse or download it, the best starting points are:

* http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/en/ - English
* http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/fr/ - French
* http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/ja/ - Japanese
* http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/ru/ - Russian

>From there, you can get to the HTML online and downloads in all formats.
Some things to note ...

Most of the HTML docs now have the sidebar on the left hand side which
ought to fix the rendering problems encountered in IE6 and IE7. The
Plugins Guide and the Migration Docs are the two exceptions. I plan to
fix those in the next week or two.

Many of the issues raised in recent weeks w.r.t. the Windows Help files
(chm format) have been fixed. Hooray! In particular, the developer docs
and foreign language docs have been broken out into their own files,
improving navigation and search (in both CHM and HTML formats). All the
CHM files now have reasonably useful Contents panels, though the Index
panels are still empty.

IMHO, the PDFs rock. Then again, I've always preferred reading
non-reference documentation on paper instead of online. I've generated
PDFs for all the English and Spanish user docs (but not Russian yet),
including the main Developer docs.

The Quick Reference cards are included in the PDF directories and well
as being available within the HTML sites. It would be nice to get Quick
Reference cards written in French and other languages and made available
via the downloads directory. (BTW, a Japanese Quick Reference for Bazaar
exists already but isn't in our codebase currently.)

If you find errors or wish to make improvements, please report bugs and
submit merge directives with the changes. Emailing me directly won't get
them fixed, sorry.

Overall, I'm really pleased with the final result here, despite it
taking far more energy over the last few weeks than I expected! I hope
you find the material helpful, well organised and well presented.

Ian C.

PS: If anyone is keen to put together a "documentation overview" page in
Spanish or other languages, grab the source for the web sites from
lp:bzr-alldocs and follow the existing examples. For Spanish in
particular, we could point directly into the Spanish docs rather than
linking to the English docs so that would be cool to have.

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer team, it gives me great pleasure to
announce our 0.8 release. While not quite feature compete enough for 1.0
status, this is our most awesome version yet with a pile of new features
to make experienced users more productive and to get new users heading
in the right direction. For downloads and a summary of the new features,
see https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.8/.

I'd like to release version 0.8.1 one week from now with updated
translations and any required emergency bug fixes. This release will be
bundled with the Windows installer for Bazaar 2.0.0 so your assistance
with making 0.8.1 as well localised and tested as possible would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Ian C.

That concerns me. I wonder if Wordpad is struggling because the files
don't initially exist? Or maybe Explorer is struggling to find Wordpad?

Your follow-up email suggested upgrading your bzr version fixed the
problem. That surprises me. I suspect the problem isn't in the bzr core
code but somewhere in Explorer. If you could try to reproduce the
problem by temporarily moving a config file out of the way say, that
would be helpful.

The Bazaar development team is happy to announce availability of the
second release candidate for bzr 2.0.0.  We expect to release 2.0.0 within
a week, with no code changes from this rc, and we would very much
appreciate testing and bug reports on this release.

The focus of this release is our new repository format, 2a, which becomes
the default in the 2.0.0 release.  This release fixes some important bugs
in the first release candidate so we recommend people using 2.0rc1
upgrade.  This release is now also suitable for use by users of earlier
bzr releases.

Starting from 2.0.0 we will maintain a stable series of 2.0.x releases,
with no api or format changes, only bug fixes. =20

Source and binaries for this release are now available from
<https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.0/2.0.0rc2>, and the changes since 2.0.0rc1
are summarized below.

-- Martin, for the bzr team


bzr 2.0.0rc2
############

:2.0.0rc2: 2009-09-10

New Features
************

* Added post_commit hook for mutable trees. This allows the keywords
  plugin to expand keywords on files changed by the commit.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #408841)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar's native protocol code now correctly handles EINTR, which most
  noticeably occurs if you break in to the debugger while connected to a
  bzr+ssh server.  You can now can continue from the debugger (by typing
  'c') and the process continues.  However, note that pressing C-\ in the
  shell may still kill the SSH process, which is bug 162509, so you must
  sent a signal to the bzr process specifically, for example by typing
  ``kill -QUIT PID`` in another shell.  (Martin Pool, #341535)

* ``bzr check`` in pack-0.92, 1.6 and 1.9 format repositories will no
  longer report incorrect errors about ``Missing inventory ('TREE_ROOT', ..=
=2E)``
  (Robert Collins, #416732)

* ``bzr info -v`` on a 2a format still claimed that it was a "Development
  format" (John Arbash Meinel, #424392)

* ``bzr log stacked-branch`` shows the full log including
  revisions that are in the fallback repository. (Regressed in 2.0rc1).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory, instead of a ``MemoryErro=
r``
  traceback.  (Martin Pool, #109115)

* Conversion to 2a will create a single pack for all the new revisions (as
  long as it ran without interruption). This improves both ``bzr upgrade``
  and ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from local branches in older formats.
  The autopack logic that occurs every 100 revisions during local
  conversions was not returning that pack's identifier, which resulted in
  the partial packs created during the conversion not being consolidated
  at the end of the conversion process. (Robert Collins, #423818)

* Fetches from 2a to 2a are now again requested in 'groupcompress' order.
  Groups that are seen as 'underutilized' will be repacked on-the-fly.
  This means that when the source is fully packed, there is minimal
  overhead during the fetch, but if the source is poorly packed the result
  is a fairly well packed repository (not as good as 'bzr pack' but
  good-enough.) (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #402652)

* Fix a potential segmentation fault when doing 'log' of a branch that had
  ghosts in its mainline.  (Evaluating None as a tuple is bad.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Fix a segmentation fault when computing the ``merge_sort`` of a graph
  that has a ghost in the mainline ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* ``groupcompress`` sort order is now more stable, rather than relying on
  ``topo_sort`` ordering. The implementation is now
  ``KnownGraph.gc_sort``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Local data conversion will generate correct deltas. This is a critical
  bugfix vs 2.0rc1, and all 2.0rc1 users should upgrade to 2.0rc2 before
  converting repositories. (Robert Collins, #422849)

* Network streams now decode adjacent records of the same type into a
  single stream, reducing layering churn. (Robert Collins)

* Prevent some kinds of incomplete data from being committed to a 2a
  repository, such as revisions without inventories, a missing chk_bytes
  record for an inventory, or a missing text referenced by an inventory.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #423506, #406687)
 =20
Documentation
*************

* Fix assertion error about "_remember_remote_is_before" when pushing to
  older smart servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #418931)

* Help on hooks no longer says 'Not deprecated' for hooks that are
  currently supported. (Ian Clatworthy, #422415)

* PDF and CHM (Windows HtmlHelp) formats are now supported for the
  user documentation. The HTML documentation is better broken up into
  topics. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The developer and foreign language documents are now separated
  out so that searching in the HTML and CHM files produces more
  useful results. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The main table of contents now provides links to the new Migration Docs
  and Plugins Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

I've fixed the test suite for bzr-loom with bzr 2.0, and addressed
'switch -b foo' not working in a loom.

https://launchpad.net/bzr-loom/2.0/2.0 has the tarball and various other
details.

-Rob

 IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr status`` now shows the current thread of the loom. (Jonathan
      Lange, #232465)

    * ``bzr switch`` now accepts ``top:`` and ``bottom:`` to jump to the to=
p
      and bottom thread respectively. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr switch -b newthread`` now works. (Robert Collins, #433811)

    * ``bzr push`` now pushes the last-loom rather than creating an empty l=
oom.
      (Robert Collins, #201613)

    * ``up`` and ``down`` are now aliases for ``up-thread`` and
      ``down-thread`` respectively.

    * ``up-thread`` now notifies when a thread becomes empty. This is a ste=
p
      towards removing it automatically/prompting to do so.
      (James Westby, #195133)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``pull`` expects the keywork local. (Mark Lee, #379347)

On behalf of the QBzr developers team, I'm happy to announce the
bugfix release of QBzr 0.14.2.

In this release two critical bugs fixed. QBzr 0.14.2 is intended to use 
with bzr 2.0. PPA, Ubuntu Karmic packages and windows installers are 
updated.

Thanks to Gary van der Merwe, John Meinel and James Westby for their 
efforts!

What is QBzr?
-------------
QBzr is a cross platform, Qt-based front-end for Bazaar, providing GUI
applications for many core bzr commands. In addition, it provides
several special dialogs and helper commands. Equivalents for core bzr
commands have the same names as CLI commands but with a prefix of "q".
Today QBzr 0.14 provides 30 user commands, 24 of them based on core
commands. QBzr works smoothly on all major platforms with Qt/PyQt
4.4.x or later.

Note: QBzr's applications are the core "GUI dialogs" in several major
Bazaar projects including:

  * Bazaar Explorer
  * QBzr-Eclipse
  * TortoiseBzr (Windows only)

So all testing, bug fixing and improvements made to QBzr benefits all
of these projects. To help with any of these, please visit QBzr on
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/qbzr.

Download
--------
If you need sources or separate windows installer you can get them from 
release page:
   https://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.14/0.14.2

PPA for Ubuntu users:
   https://launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/+archive/ppa

Release branch:
   https://code.launchpad.net/~qbzr-dev/qbzr/0.14

Whats changed:
--------------
  * qlog:
     * Fixed couple of problems with proper rendering of branch labels
       when inspecting log for several branches (e.g. in shared repo).
  * qmerge, qcommit, ...:
    * Fixed a bug where we create the QApp after opening a Branch, but 
we had
      already installed the QUIFactory(). A branch can be a lightweight 
checkout
      of a remote location which requires a password. Which wants to 
open a UI
      dialog, which causes a crash because QApp has not been created yet.
      (#430232, John Arbash Meinel)

After almost 4 years of development (the first commit is from 8
October 2005), I'm very happy to be able to announce bzr-svn 1.0!

Compared to the release candidate the final release contains a few
bug fixes for tests and fixes for some uncommon corner case bugs.

The full list of changes is:

 PERFORMANCE

  * Avoid re-fetching the basis inventory during fetch. (Jelmer Vernooij)

 BUG FIXES

  * Generate valid inventory delta's when the root of a tree is replaced wi=
th an older=20
    copy of itself. (Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Hide backtrace for EAI_NONAME errors. (John Szakmeister)

  * Allow commits without an author. (Jelmer Vernooij, #434230)

  * Cope with extra arguments to Repository._check(). (Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Properly encode symlink targets when pushing. (Jelmer Vernooij)

The tarball can be downloaded from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr-svn-1.0.0.tar.gz

And a matching GPG signature made with my new key (D729A457) can be
found at:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr-svn-1.0.0.tar.gz.asc

As always, please report any bugs you may find in Launchpad:

* https://launchpad.net/bzr-svn

Cheers,

Jelmer

We've just released the first version of the bzr-hg plugin. This plugin
(like the bzr-svn and bzr-git plugins) provides direct support in Bazaar
for accessing Mercurial repositories.

This is the initial version of the plugin, so please use with care. It
may eat your cat or (more likely) destroy your data. The mappings will
definitely change in the near future, so please don't use for production
branches yet.

At the moment it is possible to access remote Mercurial repositories
over http and to access local Mercurial repositories. It's also possible
to pull data from Mercurial into Bazaar. It's not yet possible to push
data from Bazaar into Mercurial.

The first release can be downloaded from :

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-hg-0.1.tar.gz

And a matching GPG signature from:

* http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-hg-0.1.tar.gz.asc

Please file bug reports for any bugs you find here:

 * https://launchpad.net/bzr-hg

You'll need to have a non-ancient (>=3D 1.16) version of Bazaar and
Mercurial 1.3.1 installed to be able to use bzr-hg at the moment.
Patches to support more Mercurial versions are welcome.

Cheers,

Jelmer

Congratulations Jelmer on both this and the bzr-svn 1.0.0 release. Well

I've updated the windows installer branch already. If you already had a
manual patch to add support for 1.18 there isn't really a need to
rebuild the installer. Otherwise, I would've expected bzr-rewrite to
give lots of compatibility warnings already ?

Cheers,

Jelmer

I'm happy to announce the release of bzr-git 0.4.2. This release
contains a few bug fixes as well as initial work on support for "bzr
send --format=3Dgit". Probably the most noticable fix is the one for fetch
support on Windows, without which bzr-git was practically useless on
Windows.=20

This is the full list of changes:

 BUG FIXES

  * Cope with ghosts a bit better during "bzr dpush".

  * Better error message when Dulwich is missing. (#427276)

  * Support checkouts. (#427310)
 =20
  * Don't break "bzr info -v" when Dulwich is not installed. (#429394)

  * Mark as compatible with Bazaar 2.1.

  * Fix fetching of remote repositories on Windows. Thanks INADA Naoki
(#382125)

  * Ignore directories in WorkingTree.extras(). (#373902)

 FEATURES

  * New "git" format supported by "bzr send". All revisions=20
    are currently sent as one concatenated file, rather than=20
    as separate files because of limitations in Bazaar.
    (based on the work from Lukas Lalinsky for bzr-svn)

 PERFORMANCE

  * Avoid re-fetching basis inventory during fetch.

The release can be downloaded from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.4.2.tar.gz

A GPG signature made with my key (D729A457) can be found here:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.4.2.tar.gz.asc

Please report any bugs you find in Launchpad:

 * https://launchpad.net/bzr-git

Cheers,

Jelmer

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new release of
the Bazaar adaptive version control system.  Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and
feedback.

Source and binaries are now available from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download> and the changes since the last release
are summarized below.

bzr 1.18
########

:Codename: little traveller
:1.18:    2009-08-20
:1.18rc1: 2009-08-10

This release of Bazaar marches on towards the 2.0 release in which the 2a
'brisbane-core' format becomes generally recommended.  Most of the work in
this release now focusses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering both 2a
and previous formats.  There is a new text-mode interactive merge feature,
a new guide to migration to 2a format in the user documentation, and
pushing branches to a smart server is now much faster. =20

The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long-term supported release,
with bugfix-only releases based on it continuing for at least six months
or until the following stable release.

There are no changes from 1.18rc1 to 1.18.

New Features
************

* ``bzr merge --interactive`` applies a user-selected portion of the
  merge.  The UI is similar to ``shelve``.  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr reconfigure`` now takes options ``--stacked-on URL`` and
  ``--unstacked`` to change stacking of a branch.
  (Martin Pool, #391411)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Annotating on a stacked branch will now succeed in simple scenarios.
  There are still some complex scenarios where it will fail (bug #399884)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393366)

* A progress bar is no longer left dangling when ``bzr selftest``
  completes, and the progress bar updates with zero latency so the
  displayed test name is always the one that's actually running.
  (Martin Pool, #123688)

* Authenticating against an ssh server now uses ``auth_none`` to determine
  if password authentication is even supported. This fixes a bug where
  users would be prompted for a launchpad password, even though launchpad
  only supports publickey authentication. (John Arbash Meinel, #375867)

* BranchBuilder now accepts timezone to avoid test failures in countries far
  from GMT. (Vincent Ladeuil, #397716)

* ``bzr commit`` no longer saves the unversioning of missing files until
  the commit has completed on the branch. This means that aborting a
  commit that found a missing file will leave the tree unedited.
  (Robert Collins, #282402)

* ``bzr mv`` no longer takes out branch locks, which allows it to work
  when the branch is readonly. (Robert Collins, #216541)

* ``bzr revert .`` no longer generates an InconsistentDelta error when
  there are missing subtrees. (Robert Collins, #367632)

* ``bzr send`` now generates valid bundles with ``--2a`` formats. However,
  do to internal changes necessary to support this, older clients will
  fail when trying to insert them. For newer clients, the bundle can be
  used to apply the changes to any rich-root compatible format.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #393349)

* Cope with FTP servers that don't support restart/append by falling back
  to reading and then rewriting the whole file, such as TahoeLAFS.  (This
  fallback may be slow for some access patterns.)  (Nils Durner, #294709)

* Encode the paths in ``mbcs`` encoding on Windows when spawning an
  external diff client. This at least allows supporting filenames that are
  not ascii, but are present in the current locale. Ideally we would be
  able to pass the Unicode path, but that would be client dependent.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #382709)

* Fix a compile bug on Solaris having to do with const and
  pointer-to-pointers. (John Arbash Meinel, #408441)

* Fixed a NameError that occurs when merging or pulling from a URL that
  causes a redirection loop when bzr tries to read a URL as a bundle.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #400847)

* Fix ``AttributeError: 'TestUIFactory' object has no attribute 'tick'``
  running send and similar commands on 2a formats.
  (Martin Pool, #408201)
 =20
* Fixed export to existing directory: if directory is empty then export=20
  will succeed, otherwise it fails with error.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #406174)

* Fixed spurious "Source branch does not support stacking" warning when
  pushing. (Andrew Bennetts, #388908)

* Fixed spurious transport activity indicator appearing while tests are
  running.  (Martin Pool, #343532)

* Merge now correctly handles empty right-hand revision specs.
  (Aaron Bentley, #333961)

* Renames to lexographically lower basenames in trees that have never been
  committed to will no longer corrupt the dirstate. This was caused by an
  bug in the dirstate update_minimal method. (Robert Collins, #395556)

* Requests for unknown methods no longer cause the smart server to log
  lots of backtraces about ``UnknownSmartMethod``, ``do_chunk`` or
  ``do_end``.  (Andrew Bennetts, #338561)
 =20
* Streaming from bzr servers where there is a chain of stacked branches
  (A stacked on B stacked on C) will now work. (Robert Collins, #406597)

* The environment variable ``BZR_PROGRESS_BAR`` set to either ``text`` or `=
`none``
  always forces progress bars either on or off respectively.  Otherwise,
  they're turned on if ``TERM`` is not ``dumb`` and stderr is a terminal.
  bzr always uses the 'text' user interface when run as a command, so
  ``BZR_USE_TEXT_UI`` is no longer needed.
  (Martin Pool, #339385, #387717)

* The optional ``_knit_load_data_pyx`` C extension was never being
  imported.  This caused significant slowdowns when reading data from
  repositories.  (Andrew Bennetts, #405653)
 =20
* The ``--hardlink`` option to ``branch`` and ``checkout`` is not
  supported at the moment on workingtree formats that can do content
  filtering.  (See <https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/408193>.)
  bzr now says so, rather than just ignoring the option.  (Martin Pool)

* There was a bug in ``osutils.relpath`` that was only triggered on
  Windows. Essentially if you were at the root of a drive, and did
  something to a branch/repo on another drive, we would go into an
  infinite loop while trying to find a 'relative path'.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #394227)

* ``WorkingTree4.unversion`` will no longer fail to unversion ids which
  were present in a parent tree but renamed in the working tree.
  (Robert Collins, #187207)

Improvements
************

* Can now rename/move files even if they have been removed from the invento=
ry.
  (Marius Kruger)

* Pushing branches with tags via ``bzr://`` and ``bzr+ssh://`` is much
  faster, using a new ``Branch.set_tags_bytes`` smart server verb rather
  than VFS methods.  For example, pushes of small branches with tags take
  11 rather than 18 smart server requests.  (Andrew Bennetts, #398608)

* Sending Ctrl-Break on Windows will now drop you into the debugger, in
  the same way that sending Ctrl-\\ does on other platforms.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

Documentation
*************

* Added Bazaar 2.0 Upgrade Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

API Changes
***********

* ``CLIUIFactory`` is deprecated; use ``TextUIFactory`` instead if you
  need to subclass or create a specific class, or better yet the existing
  ``make_ui_for_terminal``.  ``SilentUIFactory`` is clarified to do no
  user interaction at all, rather than trying to read from stdin but not
  writing any output, which would be strange if reading prompts or
  passwords.  (Martin Pool)

* New TransformPreview.commit() allows committing without a working tree.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``pb`` parameter to ``TextTestResult`` is deprecated and ignored.
  (Martin Pool)

* ProgressTasks now prefer to talk direct to their ProgressView not to the
  UIFactory.=20
  (Martin Pool)

* ``WorkingTree._check`` now requires a references dict with keys matching
  those returned by ``WorkingTree._get_check_refs``. (Robert Collins)

Internals
*********

* ``CHKInventory.path2id`` uses the parent_id to basename hash to avoid
  reading the entries along the path, reducing work to lookup ids from
  paths. (Robert Collins)

* ``CHKMap.apply_delta`` now raises ``InconsistentDelta`` if a delta adds
  as new a key which was already mapped. (Robert Collins)

* Inventory delta application catches more cases of corruption and can
  prevent corrupt deltas from affecting consistency of data structures on
  disk. (Robert Collins)

* --subunit support now adds timestamps if the subunit version supports
  it. (Robert Collins)

* The Windows all-in-one installer now bundles the PyQt image format
  plugins, which allows previewing more images as part of 'qdiff'.
  (Alexander Belchenko)


Testing
*******

* Merge directive cherrypick tests must use the same root id.
  (Martin Pool, #409684)

* Spurious failure in ``check`` tests on rich-root formats fixed.
  (Martin Pool, #408199)

* The ``bzrlib.tests.TextTestRunner`` will no longer call
  ``countTestsCases`` on the test being run. Progress information is
  instead handled by having the test passed in call ``result.progress``
  before running its contents. This improves the behaviour when using
  ``TextTestRunner`` with test suites that don't support
  ``countTestsCases``. (Robert Collins)

The Bazaar development team is happy to announce availability of the
second release candidate for bzr 2.0.0.  We expect to release 2.0.0 within
a week, with no code changes from this rc, and we would very much
appreciate testing and bug reports on this release.

The focus of this release is our new repository format, 2a, which becomes
the default in the 2.0.0 release.  This release fixes some important bugs
in the first release candidate so we recommend people using 2.0rc1
upgrade.  This release is now also suitable for use by users of earlier
bzr releases.

Starting from 2.0.0 we will maintain a stable series of 2.0.x releases,
with no api or format changes, only bug fixes. =20

Source and binaries for this release are now available from
<https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.0/2.0.0rc2>, and the changes since 2.0.0rc1
are summarized below.

-- Martin, for the bzr team


bzr 2.0.0rc2
############

:2.0.0rc2: 2009-09-10

New Features
************

* Added post_commit hook for mutable trees. This allows the keywords
  plugin to expand keywords on files changed by the commit.
  (Ian Clatworthy, #408841)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar's native protocol code now correctly handles EINTR, which most
  noticeably occurs if you break in to the debugger while connected to a
  bzr+ssh server.  You can now can continue from the debugger (by typing
  'c') and the process continues.  However, note that pressing C-\ in the
  shell may still kill the SSH process, which is bug 162509, so you must
  sent a signal to the bzr process specifically, for example by typing
  ``kill -QUIT PID`` in another shell.  (Martin Pool, #341535)

* ``bzr check`` in pack-0.92, 1.6 and 1.9 format repositories will no
  longer report incorrect errors about ``Missing inventory ('TREE_ROOT', ..=
=2E)``
  (Robert Collins, #416732)

* ``bzr info -v`` on a 2a format still claimed that it was a "Development
  format" (John Arbash Meinel, #424392)

* ``bzr log stacked-branch`` shows the full log including
  revisions that are in the fallback repository. (Regressed in 2.0rc1).
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory, instead of a ``MemoryErro=
r``
  traceback.  (Martin Pool, #109115)

* Conversion to 2a will create a single pack for all the new revisions (as
  long as it ran without interruption). This improves both ``bzr upgrade``
  and ``bzr pull`` or ``bzr merge`` from local branches in older formats.
  The autopack logic that occurs every 100 revisions during local
  conversions was not returning that pack's identifier, which resulted in
  the partial packs created during the conversion not being consolidated
  at the end of the conversion process. (Robert Collins, #423818)

* Fetches from 2a to 2a are now again requested in 'groupcompress' order.
  Groups that are seen as 'underutilized' will be repacked on-the-fly.
  This means that when the source is fully packed, there is minimal
  overhead during the fetch, but if the source is poorly packed the result
  is a fairly well packed repository (not as good as 'bzr pack' but
  good-enough.) (Robert Collins, John Arbash Meinel, #402652)

* Fix a potential segmentation fault when doing 'log' of a branch that had
  ghosts in its mainline.  (Evaluating None as a tuple is bad.)
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* Fix a segmentation fault when computing the ``merge_sort`` of a graph
  that has a ghost in the mainline ancestry.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #419241)

* ``groupcompress`` sort order is now more stable, rather than relying on
  ``topo_sort`` ordering. The implementation is now
  ``KnownGraph.gc_sort``. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Local data conversion will generate correct deltas. This is a critical
  bugfix vs 2.0rc1, and all 2.0rc1 users should upgrade to 2.0rc2 before
  converting repositories. (Robert Collins, #422849)

* Network streams now decode adjacent records of the same type into a
  single stream, reducing layering churn. (Robert Collins)

* Prevent some kinds of incomplete data from being committed to a 2a
  repository, such as revisions without inventories, a missing chk_bytes
  record for an inventory, or a missing text referenced by an inventory.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #423506, #406687)
 =20
Documentation
*************

* Fix assertion error about "_remember_remote_is_before" when pushing to
  older smart servers.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #418931)

* Help on hooks no longer says 'Not deprecated' for hooks that are
  currently supported. (Ian Clatworthy, #422415)

* PDF and CHM (Windows HtmlHelp) formats are now supported for the
  user documentation. The HTML documentation is better broken up into
  topics. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The developer and foreign language documents are now separated
  out so that searching in the HTML and CHM files produces more
  useful results. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The main table of contents now provides links to the new Migration Docs
  and Plugins Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)

I've fixed the test suite for bzr-loom with bzr 2.0, and addressed
'switch -b foo' not working in a loom.

https://launchpad.net/bzr-loom/2.0/2.0 has the tarball and various other
details.

-Rob

 IMPROVEMENTS:

    * ``bzr status`` now shows the current thread of the loom. (Jonathan
      Lange, #232465)

    * ``bzr switch`` now accepts ``top:`` and ``bottom:`` to jump to the to=
p
      and bottom thread respectively. (Jonathan Lange)

    * ``bzr switch -b newthread`` now works. (Robert Collins, #433811)

    * ``bzr push`` now pushes the last-loom rather than creating an empty l=
oom.
      (Robert Collins, #201613)

    * ``up`` and ``down`` are now aliases for ``up-thread`` and
      ``down-thread`` respectively.

    * ``up-thread`` now notifies when a thread becomes empty. This is a ste=
p
      towards removing it automatically/prompting to do so.
      (James Westby, #195133)

  BUGFIXES:

    * ``pull`` expects the keywork local. (Mark Lee, #379347)

    * ``setup.py`` doesn't actually install. (Mark Lee, #379069)

    * module has no attribute ``PushResult``. (Robert Collins)

On behalf of the QBzr development team I'm happy to announce the bugfix release of QBzr 0.14.3.

This release has important fix for TortoiseBzr users and provides better compatibility with 2a
format. I'm strongly recommend to update QBzr if you're using Tortoise.

Changelog
---------
 * qcommit:
    * Fixed bug with inability of run qcommit /path/to/tree/root after merge.
      (#433137, Alexander Belchenko)
 * qlog:
    * Ensure that tree objects correctly locked when checking for directories.
      (#436467, Gary van der Merwe)

Download
--------
Source code tarball:
  http://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.14/0.14.3/+download/qbzr-0.14.3.tar.gz

Installer for Windows users:
  http://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.14/0.14.3/+download/qbzr-setup-0.14.3.exe

Branch:
  lp:bzr/0.14

What is QBzr
------------
QBzr is a cross platform, Qt-based front-end for Bazaar, providing GUI
applications for many core bzr commands. In addition, it provides
several special dialogs and helper commands. Equivalents for core bzr
commands have the same names as CLI commands but with a prefix of "q".
Today QBzr 0.14 provides 30 user commands, 24 of them based on core
commands. QBzr works smoothly on all major platforms with Qt/PyQt
4.4.x or later.

Note: QBzr's applications are the core "GUI dialogs" in several major
Bazaar projects including:

 * Bazaar Explorer
 * QBzr-Eclipse
 * TortoiseBzr (Windows only)

So all testing, bug fixing and improvements made to QBzr benefits all
of these projects. To help with any of these, please visit QBzr on
Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/qbzr.

The Bazaar version control system development team is happy to announce
availability of bzr 2.0.0.  It is now available for download from
<http://bazaar-vcs.org/>, including binary packages for popular platforms.

This release of Bazaar makes the 2a format introduced in bzr 1.16
the default when new branches or repositories are created.  This format
is substantially smaller and faster for most operations.  Most of the
work in this release focuses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering
both 2a and previous formats.  See the Upgrade Guide for information on
migrating existing projects to 2a.

Bazaar 2.0 will be supported with api and format compatible bugfix-only
2.0.x releases for at least the next six months.  In parallel with this we
will make stable monthly beta releases with new features and larger
changes.

Bazaar's key benefits include:

* Flexibility to work either in either a centralized or distributed
  fashion.

* Quick branching and excellent automatic merging of changes, including
  renames of files and directories.

* Portability across all commonly used OS platforms, with integrated
  installers available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

* Compact storage of history.

* Foreign branch interfaces allowing interoperation with Subversion, git
  and Mercurial.

* A Python extension interface with over 100 plugins available.

* ... and more, see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFeatures

Bazaar is free software (GNU GPL 2+), a part of the GNU project, and
supported by Canonical Ltd.

A list of changes since 1.18.1 is attached, but some highlights are worth
including in the main announcement:

* This release also improves the documentation content and presentation,
  including adding PDF and Windows HtmlHelp versions.

* The keywords plugin can now expand keywords on files changed by the
  commit.

* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory, instead of a MemoryError
  traceback.

* 'bzr branch --switch' can now switch the checkout in the current
  directory to the newly created branch.

* 'bzr branch' of 2a repositories over HTTP is much faster.  bzr now
   batches together small fetches from 2a repositories, rather than
   fetching only a few hundred bytes at a time.

* 'bzr shelve' and 'bzr unshelve' now work on windows.

-- Martin, for the bzr team


bzr 2.0.0
#########

:2.0.0: 2009-09-22
:Codename: Instant Karma

This release of Bazaar makes the 2a (previously 'brisbane-core') format
the default when new branches or repositories are created.  This format is
substantially smaller and faster for many operations.  Most of the work in
this release focuses on bug fixes and stabilization, covering both 2a and
previous formats.  (See the Upgrade Guide for information on migrating
existing projects.)

This release also improves the documentation content and presentation,
including adding Windows HtmlHelp manuals.

The Bazaar team decided that 2.0 will be a long-term supported release,
with bugfix-only 2.0.x releases based on it, continuing for at least six
months or until the following stable release.

Changes from 2.0.0rc2 to final
******************************

* Officially branded as 2.0.0 rather than 2.0 to clarify between things
  that "want to happen on the 2.0.x stable series" versus things that want
  to "land in 2.0.0". (Changes how bzrlib._format_version_tuple() handles
  micro =3D 0.) (John Arbash Meinel)

  useful results. (Ian Clatworthy)

* The main table of contents now provides links to the new Migration Docs
  and Plugins Guide. (Ian Clatworthy)


bzr 2.0.0rc1
############

:Codename: no worries
:2.0.0rc1: 2009-08-26

Compatibility Breaks
********************

* The default format for bzr is now ``2a``. This format brings many
  significant performance and size improvements. bzr can pull from
  any existing repository into a ``2a`` one, but can only transfer
  from ``2a`` into ``rich-root`` repositories. The Upgrade guide
  has more information about this change. (Robert Collins)

* On Windows auto-detection of Putty's plink.exe is disabled.
  Default SSH client for Windows is paramiko. User still can force
  usage of plink if explicitly set environment variable BZR_SSH=3Dplink.
  (#414743, Alexander Belchenko)

New Features
************

* ``bzr branch --switch`` can now switch the checkout in the current direct=
ory
  to the newly created branch. (Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 Lalinsk=C3=BD)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fetches were being requested in 'groupcompress' order, but weren't
  recombining the groups. Thus they would 'fragment' to get the correct
  order, but not 'recombine' to actually benefit from it. Until we get
  recombining to work, switching to 'unordered' fetches avoids the
  fragmentation. (John Arbash Meinel, #402645)

* Fix a pycurl related test failure on karmic by recognizing an error
  raised by newer versions of pycurl.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #306264)

* Fix a test failure on karmic by making a locale test more robust.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #413514)

* Fix IndexError printing CannotBindAddress errors.
  (Martin Pool, #286871)

* Fix "Revision ... not present" errors when upgrading stacked branches,
  or when doing fetches from a stacked source to a stacked target.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #399140)

* ``bzr branch`` of 2a repositories over HTTP is much faster.  bzr now
  batches together small fetches from 2a repositories, rather than
  fetching only a few hundred bytes at a time.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #402657)

Improvements
************

* A better description of the platform is shown in crash tracebacks, ``bzr
  --version`` and ``bzr selftest``.
  (Martin Pool, #409137)

* bzr can now (again) capture crash data through the apport library,=20
  so that a single human-readable file can be attached to bug reports.
  This can be disabled by using ``-Dno_apport`` on the command line, or by
  putting ``no_apport`` into the ``debug_flags`` section of
  ``bazaar.conf``.
  (Martin Pool, Robert Collins, #389328)

* ``bzr push`` locally on windows will no longer give a locking error with
  dirstate based formats. (Robert Collins)

* ``bzr shelve`` and ``bzr unshelve`` now work on windows.
  (Robert Collins, #305006)

* Commit of specific files no longer prevents using the the iter_changes
  codepath. On 2a repositories, commit of specific files should now be as
  fast, or slightly faster, than a full commit. (Robert Collins)

* The internal core code that handles specific file operations like
  ``bzr st FILENAME`` or ``bzr commit FILENAME`` has been changed to
  include the parent directories if they have altered, and when a
  directory stops being a directory its children are always included. This
  fixes a number of causes for ``InconsistentDelta`` errors, and permits
  faster commit of specific paths. (Robert Collins, #347649)

Documentation
*************

* New developer documentation for content filtering.
  (Martin Pool)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.shelf_ui`` has had the ``from_args`` convenience methods of its
  classes changed to manage lock lifetime of the trees they open in a way
  consistent with reader-exclusive locks. (Robert Collins, #305006)

On behalf of the QBzr development team I'm happy to announce two new releases:
new version QBzr 0.15 (codenamed "Yellow and green") and bugfix version QBzr 0.14.4 (codenamed
"Kenny"). The latter supposed to be included in official Karmic repository.

New version QBzr 0.15 provides many new features and more than 37 bugfixes (plus all bugfixes from
0.14.x series). It's intended to be used with both bzr 2.0.1 and bzr 2.1.0b1.

I'd like to say "thank you" to all people who help us make it shine: who filed bug reports, make
translations, send us patches. Big thanks and keep doing it!

What's new in QBzr 0.15
-----------------------
 * Compatible with bzr >= 1.17 (works fine with 2.0.x and 2.1.x series).
 * New qrun dialog to launch any (non-interactive) bzr command.
 * Improved speed of qcat, qdiff, qlog.
 * Added Browse button for editor selection in qconfig.
 * qconflicts: Enable multiple selections of conflict items to resolve
   or launch merge tool for them.
 * qgetupdates and qupdate dialogs now properly support all 3 cases:
   * update tree
   * update bound branch
   * update lightweight checkout
 * qlog can display foreign revision info if available.
 * Sort tags alphabeticaly and case-insensitive in qtag dialog.
 * qexport now has sensible defaults and more user-friendly archive
   types (e.g. tar.gz instead of tgz) displayed in the combo box.
   On windows, the default archive type is now zip as well.
 * And more than 37 bugfixes (plus all critical bugfixes from 0.14.x releases).

Detailed changelog see in NEWS.txt and on the release page https://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.15/0.15

What's new in QBzr 0.14.4
-------------------------
Critical Koala bugfixes.

 * Internal: get rid of old-style classes to be compatible with PyQt 4.6.
   (#447214)
 * qlog:
   * handle revids as plain strings, not unicode. (#452235)
 * qcommit/qrevert:
   * Fixed a bug were the pending merges graph was being loaded
     twice. (Gary van der Merwe)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 2.1.0b1

This version is intended to be compatible with the 2.1.0b1 Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Bug fixes will continue to be applied to the bzrtools 2.0 series, but
there are none at this time.

Note also that bzrtools will not announce its incompatibility with
future betas, since bzr's minor version number will not change.

Changes:
No functional changes.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 1.2.1b1 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/trunk/2.1.0b1/+download/bzrtools-2.1.0b1.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/trunk/2.1.0b1/+download/bzrtools-2.1.0b1.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

MCREPOGEN (http://launchpad.net/mcrepogen), the Markov Chain Repository 
Generator, generates random version control histories with specified 
characteristics.  It uses a Markov Chain model where the states are 
directory trees and various changes to the tree have associated 
probabilities.  The intent is that by giving complete control over the 
characteristics of the history, performance testing of different aspects 
of VCS can be improved.

Download version 0.2 from http://launchpad.net/mcrepogen/+download, 
install with ``easy_install MCREPOGEN``, or pull the latest version with 
``bzr branch lp:mcrepogen``.  MCREPOGEN depends on Bazaar 
(http://bazaar-vcs.org), NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org) and the 
bzr-fastimport plugin (http://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport).

After installation, simply ``gen_random_history.py -r 1000 -o 
example.fi`` to generate 1000 random revisions with output in the 
fast-import format.  That output file can then be imported into 
different version control systems, including Bazaar, Mercurial and Git.

Bugs, questions and feedback are welcome at http://launchpad.net/mcrepogen

Changes in version 0.2:
-----------------------

- Add a new configuration file format for specifying transitions and 
their associated parameters.  Using the ``-f`` option, one can specify a 
file in INI-format that lists classes and associated parameter values to 
use in changing the tree.

- Add a number of example configurations to the distribution.

- Use setuptools for distribution

- Fix a bug with exceptions arising from moving a file.  Simply catch 
possible exceptions and skip the move, which is adequate in a 
randomly-evolving tree.

Our first post-2.0 releases of Bazaar have finally become official. Now
that we are at 2.0, we decided to split a stable releases series and a
development series. As such, 2.0.1 has only bugfixes relative to the 2.0
release, while new features and potential compatibility changes are
contained only within 2.1.0b1. All of the changes in 2.0.1 are available
in 2.1.0b1.


Thanks to everyone who has helped polish the 2.0.1 release, and ensure
that our next 2.1 stable release will have lots of interesting changes
to come.

To get your own copy, please visit http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download.
Packages for many popular platforms are available.


The short summaries of changes are:
bzr 2.0.1
#########

:Codename: Stability First
:2.0.1: 2009-10-14

The first of our new ongoing bugfix-only stable releases has arrived. It
includes a collection of 12 bugfixes applied to bzr 2.0.0, but does not
include any of the feature development in the 2.1.0 series.

bzr 2.1.0b1
###########

:Codename: While the cat is away
:2.1.0b1: 2009-10-14

This is the first development release in the new split "stable" and
"development" series. As such, the release is a snapshot of bzr.dev
without creating a release candidate first. This release includes a
fair amount of internal changes, with deprecated code being removed,
and several new feature developments. People looking for a stable code
base with only bugfixes should focus on the 2.0.1 release. All bugfixes
present in 2.0.1 are present in 2.1.0b1.

Highlights include support for ``bzr+ssh://host/~/homedir`` style urls,
finer control over the plugin search path via extended BZR_PLUGIN_PATH
syntax, visible warnings when extension modules fail to load, and
improved error handling during unlocking.

This is the full NEWS entry about all bugs/features fixed and released
relative to 2.0.0:

bzr 2.1.0b1

:Codename: While the cat is away
:2.1.0b1: 2009-10-14

This is the first development release in the new split "stable" and

finer control over the plugin search path via extended BZR_PLUGIN_PATH
syntax, visible warnings when extension modules fail to load, and improved
error handling during unlocking.


New Features
************

* Bazaar can now send mail through Apple OS X Mail.app.
  (Brian de Alwis)

* ``bzr+ssh`` and ``bzr`` paths can now be relative to home directories
  specified in the URL.  Paths starting with a path segment of ``~`` are
  relative to the home directory of the user running the server, and paths
  starting with ``~user`` are relative to the home directory of the named
  user.  For example, for a user "bob" with a home directory of
  ``/home/bob``, these URLs are all equivalent:

  * ``bzr+ssh://bob@host/~/repo``
  * ``bzr+ssh://bob@host/~bob/repo``
  * ``bzr+ssh://bob@host/home/bob/repo``

  If ``bzr serve`` was invoked with a ``--directory`` argument, then no
  home directories outside that directory will be accessible via this
  method.

  This is a feature of ``bzr serve``, so pre-2.1 clients will
  automatically benefit from this feature when ``bzr`` on the server is
  upgraded.  (Andrew Bennetts, #109143)

* Extensions can now be compiled if either Cython or Pyrex is available.
  Currently Pyrex is preferred, but that may change in the future.
  (Arkanes)

* Give more control on BZR_PLUGIN_PATH by providing a way to refer to or
  disable the user, site and core plugin directories.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #412930, #316192, #145612)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar's native protocol code now correctly handles EINTR, which most
  noticeably occurs if you break in to the debugger while connected to a
  bzr+ssh server.  You can now can continue from the debugger (by typing
  'c') and the process continues.  However, note that pressing C-\ in the
  shell may still kill the SSH process, which is bug 162509, so you must
  sent a signal to the bzr process specifically, for example by typing
  ``kill -QUIT PID`` in another shell.  (Martin Pool, #341535)

* ``bzr add`` in a tree that has files with ``\r`` or ``\n`` in the
  filename will issue a warning and skip over those files.
  (Robert Collins, #3918)

* ``bzr dpush`` now aborts if uncommitted changes (including pending merges)
  are present in the working tree. The configuration option ``dpush_strict``
  can be used to set the default for this behavior.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #438158)

* ``bzr merge`` and ``bzr remove-tree`` now requires --force if pending
  merges are present in the working tree.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #426344)

* Clearer message when Bazaar runs out of memory, instead of a
``MemoryError``
  traceback.  (Martin Pool, #109115)

* Don't give a warning on Windows when failing to import ``_readdir_pyx``
  as it is never built. (John Arbash Meinel, #430645)

* Don't restrict the command name used to run the test suite.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #419950)

* ftp transports were built differently when the kerberos python module was
  present leading to obscure failures related to ASCII/BINARY modes.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #443041)

* Network streams now decode adjacent records of the same type into a
  single stream, reducing layering churn. (Robert Collins)

* PreviewTree behaves correctly when get_file_mtime is invoked on an
unmodified
  file. (Aaron Bentley, #251532)

* Registry objects should not use iteritems() when asked to use items().
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #430510)

* Weave based repositories couldn't be cloned when committers were using
  domains or user ids embedding '.sig'. Now they can.
  (Matthew Fuller, Vincent Ladeuil, #430868)

Improvements
************

* Bazaar gives a warning before exiting, and writes into ``.bzr.log``, if
  compiled extensions can't be loaded.  This typically indicates a
  packaging or installation problem.  In this case Bazaar will keep
  running using pure-Python versions, but this may be substantially
  slower.  The warning can be disabled by setting
  ``ignore_missing_extensions = True`` in ``bazaar.conf``.
  See also <https://answers.launchpad.net/bzr/+faq/703>.
  (Martin Pool, #406113, #430529)

* Secondary errors that occur during Branch.unlock and Repository.unlock
  no longer obscure the original error.  These methods now use a new
  decorator, ``only_raises``.  This fixes many causes of
  ``TooManyConcurrentRequests`` and similar errors.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #429747)

Documentation
*************

* Describe the new shell-like test feature. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Help on hooks no longer says 'Not deprecated' for hooks that are
  currently supported. (Ian Clatworthy, #422415)

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.user_encoding`` has been removed; use
  ``bzrlib.osutils.get_user_encoding`` instead.  (Martin Pool)

* ``bzrlib.tests`` now uses ``stopTestRun`` for its ``TestResult``
  subclasses - the same as python's unittest module. (Robert Collins)

* ``diff._get_trees_to_diff`` has been renamed to
  ``diff.get_trees_and_branches_to_diff``. It is now a public API, and it
  returns the old and new branches. (Gary van der Merwe)

* ``bzrlib.trace.log_error``, ``error`` and ``info`` have been deprecated.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``MutableTree.has_changes()`` does not require a tree parameter
anymore. It
  now defaults to comparing to the basis tree. It now checks for pending
  merges too.  ``Merger.check_basis`` has been deprecated and replaced
by the
  corresponding has_changes() calls. ``Merge.compare_basis``,
  ``Merger.file_revisions`` and ``Merger.ensure_revision_trees`` have also
  been deprecated.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #440631)

* ``ProgressTask.note`` is deprecated.
  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* Added ``-Drelock`` debug flag.  It will ``note`` a message every time a
  repository or branch object is unlocked then relocked the same way.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``BTreeLeafParser.extract_key`` has been tweaked slightly to reduce
  mallocs while parsing the index (approx 3=>1 mallocs per key read).
  This results in a 10% speedup while reading an index.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* The ``bzrlib.lsprof`` module has a new class ``BzrProfiler`` which makes
  profiling in some situations like callbacks and generators easier.
  (Robert Collins)

Testing
*******

* Passing ``--lsprof-tests -v`` to bzr selftest will cause lsprof output to
  be output for every test. Note that this is very verbose! (Robert Collins)

* Setting ``BZR_TEST_PDB=1`` when running selftest will cause a pdb
  post_mortem to be triggered when a test failure occurs. (Robert Collins)

* Shell-like tests can now be written. Code in ``bzrlib/tests/script.py`` ,
  documentation in ``developers/testing.txt`` for details.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Some tests could end up with the same id, that was dormant for
  a long time.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #442980)

* Stop showing the number of tests due to missing features in the test
  progress bar.  (Martin Pool)

* Test parameterisation now does a shallow copy, not a deep copy of the test
  to be parameterised. This is not expected to break external use of test
  parameterisation, and is substantially faster. (Robert Collins)

* Tests that try to open a bzr dir on an arbitrary transport will now
  fail unless they have explicitly permitted the transport via
  ``self.permit_url``. The standard test factories such as ``self.get_url``
  will permit the urls they provide automatically, so only exceptional
  tests should need to do this. (Robert Collins)

* The break-in test no longer cares about clean shutdown of the child,
  instead it is happy if the debugger starts up. (Robert  Collins)

* The full test suite is expected to pass when the C extensions are not
  present. (Vincent Ladeuil, #430749)


bzr 2.0.1
#########

:Codename: Stability First
:2.0.1: 2009-10-14

The first of our new ongoing bugfix-only stable releases has arrived. It
includes a collection of 12 bugfixes applied to bzr 2.0.0, but does not
include any of the feature development in the 2.1.0 series.


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr add`` in a tree that has files with ``\r`` or ``\n`` in the
  filename will issue a warning and skip over those files.
  (Robert Collins, #3918)

* bzr will attempt to authenticate with SSH servers that support
  ``keyboard-interactive`` auth but not ``password`` auth when using
  Paramiko.   (Andrew Bennetts, #433846)

* Fixed fetches from a stacked branch on a smart server that were failing
  with some combinations of remote and local formats.  This was causing
  "unknown object type identifier 60" errors.  (Andrew Bennetts, #427736)

* Fixed ``ObjectNotLocked`` errors when doing some log and diff operations
  on branches via a smart server.  (Andrew Bennetts, #389413)

* Handle things like ``bzr add foo`` and ``bzr rm foo`` when the tree is
  at the root of a drive. ``osutils._cicp_canonical_relpath`` always
  assumed that ``abspath()`` returned a path that did not have a trailing
  ``/``, but that is not true when working at the root of the filesystem.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Jason Spashett, #322807)

* Hide deprecation warnings for 'final' releases for python2.6.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #440062)

* Improve the time for ``bzr log DIR`` for 2a format repositories.
  We had been using the same code path as for <2a formats, which required
  iterating over all objects in all revisions.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #374730)

* Make sure that we unlock the tree if we fail to create a TreeTransform
  object when doing a merge, and there is limbo, or pending-deletions
  directory.  (Gary van der Merwe, #427773)

* Occasional IndexError on renamed files have been fixed. Operations that
  set a full inventory in the working tree will now go via the
  apply_inventory_delta code path which is simpler and easier to
  understand than dirstates set_state_from_inventory method. This may
  have a small performance impact on operations built on _write_inventory,
  but such operations are already doing full tree scans, so no radical
  performance change should be observed. (Robert Collins, #403322)

* Retrieving file text or mtime from a _PreviewTree has good performance
when
  there are many changes.  (Aaron Bentley)

* The CHK index pages now use an unlimited cache size. With a limited
  cache and a large project, the random access of chk pages could cause us
  to download the entire cix file many times.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #402623)

* When a file kind becomes unversionable after being added, a sensible
  error will be shown instead of a traceback. (Robert Collins, #438569)

Documentation
*************

* Improved README. (Ian Clatworthy)

* Improved upgrade documentation for Launchpad branches.
  (Barry Warsaw)

I'm pleased to announce that Bazaar Explorer 0.9.0 is now available.
The highlights of this release are 3 new features:

1. Virtual repositories
2. Custom editors
3. Logging of multiple (local) branches at once.

Translations for 7 more languages have been added and numerous small
bugs have been fixed as well. For downloads and more detailed release
notes, see https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.9.0.

This release will be bundled in the pending Bazaar 2.1.0b2 installer on
Windows. For those wishing to remain on earlier versions of Bazaar, you
can run from source or wait for the standalone installer on Windows to
be built (within the next 24 hours hopefully).

Enjoy,
Ian C.

On behalf of QBzr development team I'd like to announce a release brim
with new features - QBzr 0.16 codenamed "Acacia".

This release add lots of new features for working with your working
tree. I've bloged about these (with screen shots) here:
http://bazaarvcs.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/new-working-tree-features-in-qbzr=
/


What's new in this release:

 * qswitch:
   * Added support for --create-branch option to "bzr switch". (A. S. Budde=
n)
 * SubprocessUIFactory and QUIFactory now both support get_username, and
   get_boolean. (Bug #421851, Gary van der Merwe)
 * Save the size of Dialogs when the user press Esc. (Bug #417809,
   Gary van der Merwe)
 * qlog:
   * Get the max main_line digets in a different way so that we don't break
     --no-graph. (Bug #455867, Gary van der Merwe)
   * Corrected the margin for the revision number column. (Gary van der Mer=
we)
   * When loading the file list delta, only lock the repositories that are
     being used. If the 2 trees are from the same repositories, load them
     together. (Gary van der Merwe)
   * When viewing a svn repo, only show the file list if 1 revision is sele=
cted,
     and if so, use a optimized method to do so. (Bug #450225,
     Gary van der Merwe)
   * Show a throbber above the file list while a delta is being loaded.
     (Gary van der Merwe)
   * Fix a bug when refreshing a branch with revisions that have been remov=
ed.
     (Bug #435486, Gary van der Merwe)
 * qlog/qannotate:
   * Preserve leading whitespace in the lines of the log message.
     (Max Bowsher)
 * qadd:
   * Don't show unchanged directories that contain ignored files.
     (Bug #462435, Gary van der Merwe)
 * qcommit, qadd, qrevert:

No, it would still be qbzr.  However to install it, it needs to be in

I don't really understand.   If you want to run QBzr in a different
language, use something like

LANG=3Dru_RU.UTF-8 bzr qbzr

I don't know what this is about.  You don't need to delete the pyc
files.  Just run "bzr branch lp:qbzr ~/.bazaar/plugins/qbzr" and it
should be ok.

I'd like to announce new release of scmproj plugin for bzr: scmproj v.0.5 codenamed "Subprojects".
Most visible improvements in this release is implementation of subprojects support.
Other changes see below.

New features:
 * Subprojects simplified implementation (without variants support and
   read-only flag).
 * ``project-publish --no-strict`` can be used to invoke ``push --no-strict``
   for components trees. (Bug #474799)
 * ``project-command --dry-run`` will show what would be done, but don't
   actually do anything. It's better to use with option --verbose.
 * ``project-info`` now shows the info on components and subprojects.
   (Bug #313166)
 * ``project-command --shell`` can run shell commands for each component
   instead of bzr ones. (Bug #349069)
 * ``project-command --varN XXX``: new command-line options ``--var1``,
   ``--var2`` and ``--var3`` allows user to specify additional template
   variables for substitution in commands templates. (Bug #489722)
 * commands to work with local project now possible to invoke
   from subdirectory and not only from project root. (Bug #313150)

Compatibility breaks:
 * Removed support for boxed workspaces.
 * No more pretend that we can suport any vcs other than bzr.
   Now config with VCS option set to other vcs will raise error.

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new shining and green smelling release of 
QBzr 0.17 codenamed "Sapin de Nol"! It full of new features, improvements and bugfixes.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
  * New encoding selector added to qdiff, qannotate, qcat and qviewer.
    This selector allows change of the text encoding "on the fly". See:
    http://bazaarvcs.wordpress.com/2009/12/04/selecting-file-encoding-in-qbzr/
  * qpush can auto-suggest push location for feature branches when master
    branch hosted on remote server. In the case of Launchpad it suggests
    location lp:~user/project/branch.
  * Now it's possible to tag a revision while browsing history in qlog.
  * Details on revision in qlog now have fancy dots for parent/children
    revisions, dots have the same color as in main qlog graph.
  * qcat/qviewer: show line numbers for text lines.

  * qrun now groups the commands into several categories (All, Core,
    and separate for each installed plugin)
  * New translations added: Arabic, Czech, Danish, English (United Kingdom).
  * And many other bugfixes as well.

On behalf of Ian Clatworthy I'd like to announce new release of Bazaar Explorer 0.10.0.

This release provides better advanced commands and tools editing, better integration with Launchpad 
and so on. Please, look at changelog below.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
Please edit ~/.bazaar/explorer/tools.xml (or the equivalent location
on Windows) and rename the top level folder to "My Tools".

Compatibility breaks:

* The Plugins and Advanced Commands actions have moved from the
   Tools menu into the main Bazaar menu.

New features:

* Bazaar > Advanced Commands now launches the qrun dialog by default.
   A preference is provided for users who prefer the old behaviour of
   launching a terminal instead.

* The status bar now provides a button for running lp-open.
   For a repository, the project page on Launchpad can be opened from
   that button if it can be intelligently guessed.

* For feature branches, a details panel is now displayed showing the
   submit delta so far. (This replaces the "Branch changes" experimental
   feature which is no longer available.)

* Numerous useful links have been added for Bazaar Support and
   Bazaar Development as standard tools.

* A toolbox now shares space with the working tree browser. This
   provides faster access to the standard tools, your personal tools
   and tools provided by the current hat, if any.

* A dialog is now provided for adding Tools.

Improvements:

* The default and extended toolbars now include an Advanced action.

* F8 is now a keyboard shortcut for Advanced Commands.

* The Preferences dialog now uses tabs rather than group boxes.
   (This arguably makes preferences harder to find but it scales
   better as new preferences are added later.)

* Custom dialog boxes are now individually configurable so that
   heavyweight checkouts can be used with the qgetnew dialog, but
   feature branches can be made with the custom init dialog.
   The old 'custom-dialogs' setting is no longer used so you
   can delete it from explorer.conf if you wish.
   (A. S. Budden)

Bug fixes:

* Allow switch action for bound branches (heavyweight checkouts).
   (A. S. Budden, Bug #479356)

* Create parent(s) of ~/.bazaar/explorer directory if needed.
   (A. S. Budden, Bug #474812)

Translations:

* Added Greek translation.

About
-----
Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application for using the Bazaar Version Control System. It provides a 
high level interface to all commonly used features, launching "applets" from the QBzr plug-in to 
provide most of the functionality. Alternatively, the applets from the bzr-gtk plug-in can be used 
if it is installed. Bazaar Explorer runs on GNOME, KDE, Windows and Mac OS X. It requires Bazaar 2.0 
or later and QBzr 0.17 or later.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new releases of
the bzr adaptive version control system. Bazaar is part of the GNU
system <http://gnu.org/>.

The third release of Bazaar 2.0 (2.0.3) has a small handful of bugfixes.
As expected, this has no internal or external compatibility changes
versus 2.0.2 (or 2.0.0).

The fourth beta release in the 2.1 series brings with it a significant
number of bugfixes (~20). The test suite is once again (finally) "green"
on Windows, and should remain that way for future releases. There are a
few performance related updates (faster upgrade and log), and several UI
tweaks. There has also been a significant number of tweaks to the
runtime documentation. 2.1.0b4 include everything from the 2.0.3 release.

It is expected that the next release in the 2.1 series will be 2.1.0rc1,
which means it will then enter into its stable bugfix-only phase (and
2.2.0b1 will be opened for development.)

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Both the source and platform specific binaries can be downloaded from
  https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.0/2.0.3
  https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.1/2.1.0b4

As always, all releases are available from

The full changelog for 2.1.0b4 and 2.0.3 follows:

bzr 2.1.0b4
###########

:Codename: san francisco airport
:2.1.0b4: 2009-12-14

The fourth beta release in the 2.1 series brings with it a significant
number of bugfixes (~20). The test suite is once again (finally)
"green" on Windows, and should remain that way for future releases.
There are a few performance related updates (faster upgrade and log),
and several UI tweaks. There has also been a significant number of
tweaks to the runtime documentation. 2.1.0b4 include everything from
the 2.0.3 release.


Compatibility Breaks
********************

* The BZR_SSH environmental variable may now be set to the path of a
  secure shell client. If currently set to the value ``ssh`` it will
  now guess the vendor of the program with that name, to restore the
  old behaviour that indicated the SSH Corporation client use
  ``sshcorp`` instead as the magic string.
  (Martin <gzlist@googlemail.com>, #176292)

New Features
************

* ``bzr commit`` now has a ``--commit-time`` option.
  (Alexander Sack, #459276)

* ``-Dhpss`` now increases logging done when run on the bzr server,
  similarly to how it works on the client. (John Arbash Meinel)

* New option ``bzr unshelve --keep`` applies the changes and leaves
  them on the shelf.  (Martin Pool, Oscar Fuentes, #492091)

* The ``BZR_COLUMNS`` envrionment variable can be set to force bzr to
  respect a given terminal width. This can be useful when output is
  redirected or in obscure cases where the default value is not
  appropriate. Pagers can use it to get a better control of the line
  lengths.  (Vincent Ladeuil)

Bug Fixes
*********

* After renaming a file, the dirstate could accidentally reference
  ``source\\path`` rather than ``source/path`` on Windows. This might
  be a source of some dirstate-related failures. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzr commit`` now detects commit messages that looks like file
  names and issues a warning.  (Gioele Barabucci, #73073)

* ``bzr ignore /`` no longer causes an IndexError.
  (Gorder Tyler, #456036)

* ``bzr log -n0 -rN`` should not return revisions beyond its merged
  revisions.  (#325618, #484109, Marius Kruger)

* ``bzr merge --weave`` and ``--lca`` will now create ``.BASE`` files
  for files with conflicts (similar to ``--merge3``). The contents of the
  file is a synthesis of all bases used for the merge.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #40412)

* ``bzr mv --quiet`` really is quiet now.  (Gordon Tyler, #271790)

* ``bzr serve`` is more clear about the risk of supplying
  --allow-writes.  (Robert Collins, #84659)

* ``bzr serve --quiet`` really is quiet now.  (Gordon Tyler, #252834)

* Fix bug with redirected URLs over authenticated HTTP.
  (Glen Mailer, Neil Martinsen-Burrell, Vincent Ladeuil, #395714)

* Interactive merge doesn't leave branch locks behind.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* Lots of bugfixes for the test suite on Windows. We should once again
  have a test suite with no failures on Windows. (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``osutils.terminal_width()`` obeys the BZR_COLUMNS environment
  variable but returns None if the terminal is not a tty (when output
  is redirected for example). Also fixes its usage under OSes that
  doesn't provide termios.TIOCGWINSZ. Make sure the corresponding
  tests runs on windows too.
  (Joke de Buhr, Vincent Ladeuil, #353370, #62539)
  (John Arbash Meinel, Vincent Ladeuil, #492561)

* Terminate ssh subprocesses when no references to them remain, fixing
  subprocess and file descriptor leaks.  (Andrew Bennetts, #426662)

* The ``--hardlink`` option of ``bzr branch`` and ``bzr checkout`` now
  works for 2a format trees.  Only files unaffected by content filters
  will be hardlinked.  (Andrew Bennetts, #408193)

* The new glob expansion on Windows would replace all ``\`` characters
  with ``/`` even if it there wasn't a glob to expand, the arg was
  quoted, etc. Now only change slashes if there is something being
  glob expanded.  (John Arbash Meinel, #485771)

* Use our faster ``KnownGraph.heads()`` functionality when computing
  the new rich-root heads. This can cut a conversion time in half
  (mysql from 13.5h => 6.2h) (John Arbash Meinel, #487632)

* When launching a external diff tool via bzr diff --using, temporary
  files are no longer created, rather, the path to the file in the
  working tree is passed to the external diff tool. This allows the
  file to be edited if the diff tool provides for this.
  (Gary van der Merwe, #490738)

* The launchpad-open command can now be used from a subdirectory of a
  branch, not just from the root of the branch.  (Neil
  Martinsen-Burrell, #489102)


Improvements
************

* ``bzr log`` is now faster. (Ian Clatworthy)

* ``bzr update`` provides feedback on which branch it is up to date
  with.  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* ``bzr upgrade`` from pre-2a to 2a can be significantly faster (4x).
  For details see the xml8 patch and heads() improvements.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``bzrlib.urlutils.local_path_from_url`` now accepts
  'file://localhost/' as well as 'file:///' URLs on POSIX.  (Michael
  Hudson)

* The progress bar now shows only a spinner and per-operation counts,
  not an overall progress bar.  The previous bar was often not
  correlated with real overall operation progress, either because the
  operations take nonlinear time, or because at the start of the
  operation Bazaar couldn't estimate how much work there was to do.
  (Martin Pool)

Documentation
*************

* Lots of documentation tweaks for inline help topics and command help
  information.

API Changes
***********

* ``bzrlib.textui`` (vestigial module) removed.  (Martin Pool)

Internals
*********

* New test Feature: ``ModuleAvailableFeature``. It is designed to make
  it easier to handle what tests you want to run based on what modules
  can be imported. (Rather than lots of custom-implemented features
  that were basically copy-and-pasted.) (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``osutils.timer_func()`` can be used to get either ``time.time()``
  or ``time.clock()`` when you want to do performance timing.
  ``time.time()`` is limited to 15ms resolution on Windows, but
  ``time.clock()`` gives CPU and not wall-clock time on other
  platforms.  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Several code paths that were calling ``Transport.get().read()`` have
  been changed to the equalivent ``Transport.get_bytes()``. The main
  difference is that the latter will explicitly call ``file.close()``,
  rather than expecting the garbage collector to handle it. This helps
  with some race conditions on Windows during the test suite and sftp
  tests. (John Arbash Meinel)

Testing
*******

* TestCaseWithMemoryTransport no longer sets $HOME and $BZR_HOME to
  unicode strings. (Michael Hudson, #464174)


bzr 2.0.3
#########

:Codename: little italy
:2.0.3: 2009-12-14

The third stable release of Bazaar has a small handful of bugfixes. As
expected, this has no internal or external compatibility changes
versus 2.0.2 (or 2.0.0).


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr push --use-existing-dir`` no longer crashes if the directory
  exists but contains an invalid ``.bzr`` directory.  (Andrew
  Bennetts, #423563)

* Content filters are now applied correctly after pull, merge and
  switch. (Ian Clatworthy, #385879)

* Fix a potential segfault in the groupcompress hash map handling
  code.  When inserting new entries, if the final hash bucket was
  empty, we could end up trying to access if ``(last_entry+1)->ptr ==
  NULL``.  (John Arbash Meinel, #490228)

* Improve "Binary files differ" hunk handling.
  (Aaron Bentley, #436325)

Hi,

I'm happy to announce new point release of scmproj 0.5.1
codenamed "The Great Commander".

The changes in this release is mostly focused on improving 
project-command (pcmd), project-update and project-publish commands.

Now it's possible to easily specify for which components you want to run 
your commands (with pcmd --include/--exclude/--select).

Also I've added new (simple) feature to internal commands executor: 
using some checker function it's possible to check component tree for 
some condition and run the command only for components which conform the 
condition. Possible conditions are:
* all components;
* tree has changed files;
* tree has only unchanged files;
* local branch and origin branch have different tips;
* local branch and origin branch have equal tips.

These conditions automatically used by other commands like 
project-commit, project-update, project-publish.

The net effect from this small improvements is much friendlier and 
faster interface. Commands now prints mostly only useful info, which is 
important if you have more than 3-5 components.

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of 
QBzr 0.18 codenamed "Pine-needles"! It provides some new features and 
important bugfixes. Many thanks to all QBzr contributors!

QBzr 0.18 intended to be used with bzr 2.1.0rc1 (and most likely final). 
Gary and me think this release will be included to next Ubuntu Lucid 
release, so we will highly appreciate thorough testing of this release 
by your day-to-day usage.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
  * Fixed problems with rename items in subdirectory. (Bug #495519, 
INADA Naoki)
  * Flush clipboard on exit, so data copied there is available after 
closing of
    q-window. (Bug #503401)
  * Fixed problem with insufficient width of revno column in qannotate and
    qbrowse (for revision tree) if revno bigger than 9999.
    (Bug #505990, Alexander Belchenko)
  * Changed buttons behavior in subprocess-based dialogs: if the operation
    failed then show Retry button (instead of OK), at the successfull finish
    show only Close button. (Simon Kersey)
  * qrun has new option --execute which allows to run the supplied command
    immediately. If the command failed user can edit the command and its
    arguments in usual way. (Simon Kersey)
  * Fixed a bug in the new SyntaxHighlighter used in qannotate and qcat 
so that
    it correctly handle tokens without styles. (Bug #508281, Gary van 
der Merwe)
  * Fixed a bug in TreeWidget were some times duplicated in parent 
directories.
    (Gary van der Merwe)
  * qbranch has a new --bind option for convenient binding to the parent
    location while branching.
  * qcommit: Non versioned files are now selected by select all when 
they are
    shown. (Bug #490864, Gary van der Merwe)
  * Serbian translations added.

I'm happy to release the availability of the next version of bzr-git,
version 0.4.3.

Changes in this release:

 BUG FIXES

  * Fix warning about unclosed files on Windows. (#441978, INADA Naoki)

  * Support creating working tree for existing repository.

  * Fix base url of Git branches - use the working tree path rather
than=20
    the control directory path.

  * Fix fetching between git repositories. (#449507)

  * Refuse pulling into non-rich-root branches rather than erroring=20
    out with an AttributeError. (#449507)

  * Unquote paths extracted from URLs. (#445156)

 PERFORMANCE

  * Improve performance of WorkingTree.extras() by not looking up the=20
    SHA1, kind and stat data of each file.=20

  * Provide custom InterTree for faster deltas between git working
trees=20
    and revision trees.

  * Provide custom InterTree for faster deltas between git revision
trees.

  * Fix several places where a lot of memory was being consumed,
especially
    for repositories with a large number of revisions or big trees.
    (#486076)

 FEATURES

  * Support for parsing --HG-- metadata in git commit messages, for=20
    better interoperability with bzr-hg.

  * Submodules are now imported. This requires the use of the=20
    development-subtree format in bzrlib though. (#402814)

The package can be downloaded from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.4.3.tar.gz

A signature made with my key (D729A457) can be found at:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.4.3.tar.gz.asc

Cheers,

Jelmer

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm pleased to announce our
0.11.2 release. See https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/0.11.2 for
the release notes and source code download. A windows installer will be
made available shortly. This release requires Bazaar 1.13 or later and
QBzr 0.17 or later. Bazaar 2.1.0rc1 and QBzr 0.18 are recommended.

Highlights of this release include:

* a more intelligent working tree browser including state-based
  filtering and popup menus

* a location selector which groups objects in the same repository
  together (enabled via a preference)

* more flexible ways of initialising a workspace (and plugins can
  provide their own workspace models complete with custom parameters)

* initial support for colocated branches.

As always, feedback is welcome. I'm particularly keen to hear about
suggestions for improving the UI workflows around colocated branches.
For example, what "What's Next?" actions should be offered if a branch
or checkout is opened in a colocated repository? Ditto for branch
creation, both fetching a remote branch into a yet-to-be-created
colocated workspace and creating a new feature branch. I hope to
incorporate the feedback into the 1.0beta release, 2 weeks from now.

Enjoy,
Ian C.

Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 2.1.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 2.1.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
- - shell accepts --directory, and runs qbzr commands in a subprocess
- - conflict-diff no longer requires a single file to be specified.
  Multiple files can be specified, but it's not necessary to specify any
  files.
- - fetch-ghosts now works again

Thanks to Max Bowsher and Gordon Tyler for their contributions.

For more information on BzrTools, please see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 2.1.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/trunk/2.1.0/+download/bzrtools-2.1.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/trunk/2.1.0/+download/bzrtools-2.1.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'm proud to announce the
availability of Release Candidate 1 of our 1.0.0 release. Unless
critical bugs are found in the next few days, this release ought to be
identical to 1.0.0 due for release on the 21-Feb-2010.

A document outlining the new features since 0.8.x (the version bundled
with bzr 2.0.x) is now available:
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/whats-new/whats-new-in-1.0.html.
Source code and release notes (vs 1.0.0beta) are available here:
https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/trunk/1.0.0rc1.

Bazaar Explorer is a cross-platform GUI application that runs on
GNU/Linux, Windows and OS X. With a clean design and flexible extensions
architecture, it is suitable for everyone in your team or community,
from beginner to expert. When used in combination with the bzr-svn,
bzr-git and bzr-hg plugins, Bazaar Explorer can be used as a VCS client
for most software projects. Our 1.0 release is a huge step towards
Bazaar Explorer's goal of becoming *the* desktop "hub" for collaborating
on distributed software projects, regardless of upstream VCS or hosting
service.

Keen to get involved? Please read our latest roadmap[1] and join the
team[2]!

Enjoy,
Ian C.

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer developers, I'd like to announce second candidate for 1.0.0 
release. We expect to release 1.0.0 final in next few days. 1.0.0rc2 is suitable to be bundled with 
bzr 2.1.1 and later.

A document outlining the new features since 0.8.x (the version bundled
with bzr 2.0.x) is now available:
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/explorer/en/whats-new/whats-new-in-1.0.html.
Source code and release notes (vs 1.0.0rc1) are available here:
https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/1.0/1.0.0rc2

Bazaar Explorer is a cross-platform GUI application that runs on
GNU/Linux, Windows and OS X. With a clean design and flexible extensions
architecture, it is suitable for everyone in your team or community,
from beginner to expert. When used in combination with the bzr-svn,
bzr-git and bzr-hg plugins, Bazaar Explorer can be used as a VCS client
for most software projects. Our 1.0 release is a huge step towards
Bazaar Explorer's goal of becoming *the* desktop "hub" for collaborating
on distributed software projects, regardless of upstream VCS or hosting
service.

>From the team summary on https://launchpad.net/~bzr-packagers ...

This team is dedicated to improving Bazaar packaging. Our goals are to:

* Streamline the packaging process so that maintaining packages and
creating new combinations of components is easier.

* Improve consistency of packaging across operating systems, e.g.
ensuring that the same set of plugins are including in the Windows and
OS X installers.

* Suggest changes to core bzr code, plugins and processes to improve
packaging support, e.g. better support for Ubuntu PPAs and Python
packaging technologies like pip.

That was meant to be "the 2.1.0-3 bundle for OS X".

Apologies for any confusion,

On behalf of the bzr-git developers, I'm happy to announce the release
of the next version of bzr-git, 0.5.0. The main reason for doing this
release now is that existing versions of bzr-git break with newer
versions of Python, including the one in Lucid.

There aren't any mindblowing changes since the last release, other than
a large number of bug fixes. The full list of changes is:

 BUG FIXES

  * Fix compatibility with newer versions of Python2.6, which change
    the behaviour of urlparse.urlsplit. (Jelmer Vernooij)
=20
  * Avoid storing texts of symlinks, which causes checksum errors in=20
    `bzr check`. (#512323, INADA Naoki, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Support committing to a git branch from a bzr working tree.
    (#506174, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Support executable symlinks. (#512871, INADA Naoki, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * When unpacking URLs, strip leftmost slash to match gits=20
    behaviour. (#445156, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Support merging tags to a local Git repository.
    (#4445230, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * InterFromGitBranch.pull() supports an optional limit argument=20
    to limit how many revisions to import in one go. (Michael Hudson)

  * Cope with different encodings better, rather than just stripping
    out unknown characters. (#529460, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Support ``run_hooks`` argument to
``InterGitRemoteLocalBranch.pull()``. (#524843, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Properly ignore directories when creating bundles, deal with new
    files. (#456849, Jelmer Vernooij)

 PERFORMANCE

  * Don't import head revision twice when pulling from Git.
    (Jelmer Vernooij)

 FEATURES

  * Support (dumb) HTTP repositories. (#373688, Jelmer Vernooij)

  * Implement API for colocated branches. (#380871, Jelmer Vernooij)

The new release can be downloaded from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.5.0.tar.gz

GPG signatures made with my GPG key can be found at:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-git-0.5.0.tar.gz.asc

As always, please report bugs in Launchpad:

Cheers,

Jelmer

I'm happy to announce the next release of bzr-rewrite, 0.6.0. The
plugin is now officially no longer renamed bzr-rebase since it also
intends to provide other generic commands that can rewrite Bazaar
revisions.

The changes since the last release are:

  BUG FIXES

   * Treat a stop revision as inclusive, not exclusive.=20
     (Max Bowsher, Jelmer Vernooij)

   * Fix rebase to not discard revisions off the leftmost path.
     (Robert Collins, Max Bowsher, #266897)

   * Mark as compatible with bzr 2.2. (Jelmer Vernooij)

  CHANGES

   * Rename plugin to bzr-rewrite (from bzr-rebase).

   * svn-upgrade/foreign-mapping-upgrade was removed. Use rebase-foreign
     instead. (Jelmer Vernooij)

The release can be downloaded from:

 * http://samba.org/~jelmer/bzr/bzr-rewrite-0.6.0.tar.gz

A GPG signature made with my key (D729A457) can be found at:

Cheers,

Jelmer

This is a refresh of bzr-loom to work with current bzrlib. No
functionality changes per se, though it should be better behaved with
switch in general.

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of
QBzr 0.19 codenamed "Shepherd's Tree, aka Boscia albitrunca".
This release intended to be used as companion release for bzr 2.2, and 
also supports bzr 2.1.

There is many changes since QBzr 0.18, so I'm highlighting only major ones:

* qannotate has new look and feel; with new features: find text and goto 
to line.

* Improved performance of qlog, and treewidget-based dialogs (qcommit, 
qadd, qrevert etc.)

* qpush, qmerge, etc.: When there are uncommitted changes in the working 
tree, user has the option to commit, or revert.

* qcommit: user can update bound branch/chgeckout if it is not up to date.

* Fixed bug with Mac OS X support when windows start in background. 
(Thanks to Luis Arias)

* qlog: Context menu actions for tag, and revert will now show a branch 
menu if more than one branch is open.

* qlog: more context menu actions for update, cherry-pick, and reverse 
cherry-pick.

* Language of GUI can be set in DEFAULT section of bazaar.conf as 
``language = code``. Language codes are the same as for LANG environment 
   variable. Environment variable LANGUAGE still preferred over settings 
   in bazaar.conf.

* Many other improvements and bug fixes. (See the full changelog below).

We've just released bzr-gtk 0.99.0, a minor release that fixes a couple
of bugs and marks bzr-gtk as compatible with the latest stable Bazaar
release, 2.2. It also spins off Olive into its own project once more,
making the relation between bzr-gtk and Olive similar to that of qbzr
and bzr-explorer.

Changes since 0.98.0:

BUG FIXES

   * Guard setup() call when not loaded as __main__. (Robert Collins)

   * Ignore gnomekeyring.IOError when checking if credentials are
available
     in the GNOME keyring. (Jelmer Vernooij, #534326)

   * Don't crash when there is already a lan-notify instance running.
     (Jelmer Vernooij, #339284)

   * Return the credentials if successfully found in gnome-keyring.
     (John Szakmeister)

   * Support non-bzr patches. (Toshio Kuratomi, #502076)

   * Avoid using private functions to get branch config. (Jelmer
Vernooij,
     #583554)

   * Mark as compatible with Bazaar 2.2. (Martin Pool, #597379)

FEATURES

  * Add 'Find' button to start text search.
    (Martin Pool, #556347)

  * Add 'glog' as an alias for visualize (aka viz) as too many
    people are still confused.
    (Vincent Ladeuil)

  * Add support for Indicator Application (Sense Hofstede, Jelmer
Vernooij,
    #518179)

The release can be downloaded from Launchpad:

 https://edge.launchpad.net/bzr-gtk/trunk/0.99.0

Please report any bugs you find in the Launchpad bug tracker:

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer Developers, I'm pleased to announce
"Bartolomeu Dias", our 1.1.1 release.

Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application for using the Bazaar version 
control system, a modern VCS that supports both centralized and 
distributed version control. Our 1.1.1 release runs on GNU/Linux (both 
GNOME and KDE), Windows and OS X desktops and is available in many 
languages.

As release manager I'd like to say big thank you for everybody who
have contributed source code, bug reports, documentation, translations
and inspiration to this release. And especially to Ian, Simon, Gordon 
and Gary.

NOTE for windows users of standalone bzr installer 2.2 and 2.2.1: please 
install bzr-explorer 1.1.1, because it fixes ugly bug in explorer 1.1.0.


Download
========
See page https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/1.1/1.1.1 for tarball and 
windows installer.


Full changelog since 1.0.x
==========================
1.1.1 04-Oct-2010
-----------------

Bug fixes:

* Open the shared repository with branches without parent location set
   no more produce traceback. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #650708)


1.1.0 final 28-Sep-2010
-----------------------

New features:

* Running Update and Unbind actions (qupdate and qunbind dialogs)
   without waiting for user pressing OK in dialogs (using --execute
   option in dialogs). (Luis Arias)

* Add a new tool type, 'shell'. (Tres Seaver)

   Tools of this type pass their command line through to the OS shell. This
   allows "normal" shell scripting techniques to work:

    - Shell variable expansions.
    - Setting environment variables
    - Pipelines
    - Changing directories

Improvements:

* Filtering the working tree is now faster. (Gary van der Merwe)

Bug fixes:

* Custom switch dialog in colocated workspace works correctly with old 
PyQt 4.4.
   (Bug #582714, Alexander Belchenko)

* Fixed filter bar in repository view (Simon Kersey, #565083)

* Fixed refresh when directory renamed/deleted (Simon Kersey, #568728)

* Fix finding bzr.exe when running from bzrw.exe with out full path in the
   command line. Handel been launched from tortoisebzr without it having to
   change sys.executable. (Bug #641557, Gary van der Merwe)

* Fixed working tree browser show annotate/log options when undocked
   (Simon Kersey, #634989)

Translations:

* Persian translation added.

Notes:

* bzr-explorer now requires qbzr 0.19.


1.1.0 beta1 04-Aug-2010
-----------------------

New features:

* A tree style location selector is now supported as a preference.
   (Gordon Tyler, #403853)

* Language of the GUI can be set in DEFAULT section of bazaar.conf
   as ``language = code``. Language codes are the same as for LANG 
environment
   variable. Environment variable LANGUAGE still preferred over settings
   in bazaar.conf. (Alexander Belchenko)

* To change default language of the GUI via Bazaar Explorer:
   Tools -> Options -> Appearance -> User Interface -> Language.
   Bazaar Explorer should be restarted to apply new language settings.
   (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #433784)

Improvements:

* tree-style toolboxes are now available on Windows.

* Added tool type 'bzr-exec' - tools with this type run immediately, 
when the
   tool is selected, rather than requiring further user confirmation.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed tools.xml parsing issues (Simon Kersey, #548971)

* Support nested folders in toolbars and the toolbox
   (Simon Kersey, Bug #564811)



Enjoy,
Alexander Belchenko

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce version 1.0.0 "Annoying Air-Lock" of the pipeline
plugin, a tool for grouping sets of related changes into manageable
chunks.  For more information, see
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPipeline or "bzr help pipeline".

This version is intended to be compatible with versions 2.2.0 to 2.3.x
of bzr.

This is the initial release, prompted by Carlo Strub.  A recently-added
feature is the ability to specify pump --from to merge changes from any
arbitrary branch into the pipeline.  Next time I release, I'll be able
to list changes since 1.0.0.

The release tarball is here:
http://launchpad.net/bzr-pipeline/trunk/1.0.0/+download/bzr-pipeline-1.0.0.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzr-pipeline/trunk/1.0.0/+download/bzr-pipeline-1.0.0.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce version 1.1 "Bloated Basin" of the pipeline
plugin, a tool for grouping sets of related changes into manageable
chunks.  For more information, see
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPipeline or "bzr help pipeline".

This version is intended to be compatible with versions 2.2.x to
2.3.x of Bazaar.

Changes:
 - bzr pump supports --show-base, --reprocess and --merge-type.
 - Pipes can no longer be accidentally named ":next", etc.
 - Pipeline imposes smaller start-up cost when not used.

The release tarball is here:
http://launchpad.net/bzr-pipeline/stable/1.1/+download/bzr-pipeline-1.1.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzr-pipeline/stable/1.1/+download/bzr-pipeline-1.1.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Aaron

Hash: SHA1

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of
QBzr 0.20.0

This release intended to be used as companion release for bzr 2.3, and
also supports bzr 2.2.

What's new in this release
- --------------------------
* Refactor the config code:
   * Remove the QBzrGlobalConfig class so that we only have one class
     that writes to qbzr.conf.
   * Have a global cache for the QBzrConfig, like we have for bzr
     GlobalConfig, to reduce reading the config from disk.
   * Refactor the window.saveSize methods, so that we only have to
     write the config to disk once.
   * Lock the config dir when when saving the config file.
     (Gary van der Merwe)
 * qrun: fixed '--execute' mode. (Bug #590229, Simon Kersey)
 * qlog:
   * Refactor loggraphprovider so that the state and computed data is
     separated from the cache. Rename to loggraphviz.
   * Write lots of tests for loggraphviz.
   * Remove LogFilterProxyModel which improves performance.
   * --no-graph mode now shows nodes per revision, indented by merge
     depth.
   * Fix the layout of octopus merges. (Bug #489383)
   * Add a option --show-trees that shows working tree changes as a node
     in the graph.
   * Fix bug with show log form the tree widget with remote branch.
     (Bug #621934)
 * qcommit: added option to load commit message from a file.
   (Bug #640071, Philip Peitsch)
 * qconflicts: fix bug with access to QBzr configuration. (Bug #675894)
 * When a interupt signal is recived, close rather than showing a error
   message. (Gary van der Merwe)
 * qpush: fixed smart suggestion of new push URLs for lp branches.
   (Bug #710767, Alexander Belchenko)

The Bazaar team is happy to announce availability of a new
release of the bzr adaptive version control system.
Bazaar is part of the GNU system <http://gnu.org/>.

This is the first beta of the 2.4 series, leading up to a 2.4.0 release
in August 2012. Beta releases are suitable for everyday use but may
cause some incompatibilities with plugins. Some plugins may need small
updates to work with 2.4b1.

2.4b1 includes a new changelog merge plugin, better configuration for
external merge tools and some enhanced features for the configuration
files.

It also includes bug fixes for 2.0.7, 2.1.4 and 2.2.5 and ~40 fixes of
its own so all known fixed bugs are included here.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4b1/ as a source tarball; packages
for various systems will be available soon, OSX and windows installers
are already available from the url above.

bzr 2.4b1
#########

:2.4b1: 2011-04-17

This is the first beta of the 2.4 series, leading up to a 2.4.0
release in August 2011. Beta releases are suitable for everyday use
but may cause some incompatibilities with plugins. Some plugins may need
small updates to work with 2.4b1.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

(none)

New Features
************

* Added ``changelog_merge`` plugin for merging changes to ``Changelog`` files
  in GNU format. See ``bzr help changelog_merge`` for details.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Configuration options can now use references to other options in the same
  file by enclosing them with curly brackets (``{other_opt}``). This makes it
  possible to use, for example,
  ``push_location=lp:~vila/bzr/config-{nickname}`` in ``branch.conf`` when
  using a loom. During the beta period, the default behavior is to disable
  this feature. It can be activated by declaring ``bzr.config.expand = True``
  in ``bazaar.conf``. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* External merge tools can now be configured in bazaar.conf. See
  ``bzr help configuration`` for more information. (Gordon Tyler, #489915)

* The ``lp:`` directory service now supports Launchpad's QA staging.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #667483)

Improvements
************

* A new hidden command ``bzr repair-workingtree``. This is a way to force
  the dirstate file to be rebuilt, rather than using a ``bzr checkout``
  workaround. (John Arbash Meinel)

* Added a ``Branch.heads_to_fetch`` RPC to the smart server protocol.
  This allows formats from plugins (such as looms) to efficiently tell the
  client which revisions need to be fetched. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Branching, merging and pulling a branch now copies revisions named in
  tags, not just the tag metadata. (Andrew Bennetts, #309682)

* ``bzr cat-revision`` no longer requires a working tree.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #704405)

* ``bzr export --per-file-timestamps`` for .tar.gz files will now
  override the mtime for trees exported on Python 2.7 and later, which
  expose the 'mtime' field in gzip files. This makes the output of
  ``bzr export --per-file-timestamps`` for a particular tree
  deterministic. (Jelmer Vernooij, #711226)

* ``bzr export --format=zip`` can now export to standard output,
  like the other exporters can. (Jelmer Vernooij, #513752)

* ``bzr export`` can now create ``.tar.xz`` and ``.tar.lzma`` files.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #551714)

Bug Fixes
*********

* A MemoryError thrown on the server during a remote operation will now be
  usefully reported, and other unexpected errors will include the class name.
  (Martin [gz], #722416)

* ``bzr annotate -r-1 file`` will now properly annotate a deleted file.
  (Andrew King, #537442)

* ``bzr export`` to zip files will now set a mode on directories.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #207253)

* ``bzr export`` to tgz files will only write out the basename of the
  tarfile to the gzip file. (Jelmer Vernooij, #102234)

* ``bzr push --overwrite`` with an older revision specified will now correctly
  roll back the target branch. (Jelmer Vernooij, #386576)

* ``bzr lp-propose`` can now propose merges against packaging branches on
  Launchpad without requiring the target branch to be specified.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #704647)

* ``bzr lp-propose`` no longer requires a reviewer to be specified. It will
  instead leave setting the reviewer up to Launchpad if it was not specified.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #583772)

* ``bzr pull`` will now exit with exit code 1 if there were tag conflicts.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #213185)

* ``bzr mv`` user errors no longer throw UnicodeEncodeError with non-ascii
  paths, however they may still print junk if not on a UTF-8 terminal.
  (Martin [gz], #707954)

* ``bzr reconfigure --unstacked`` now copies revisions (and their
  ancestors) named in tags into the unstacked repository, not just the
  ancestry of the branch's tip. (Andrew Bennetts, #401646)

* ``bzr serve`` no longer crashes when a server_started hook is installed and
  IPv6 support is available on the system. (Jelmer Vernooij, #293697)

* ``bzr tags`` will no longer choke on branches with ghost revisions in
  their mainline and tags on revisions not in the branch ancestry.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #397556)

* ``bzr whoami`` will now display an error if both a new identity and
  ``--email`` were specified. (Jelmer Vernooij, #680449)

* ``launchpadlib`` doesn't provide the ``uris`` module in some old versions.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #706835)

* Empty entries in the ``NO_PROXY`` variable are no longer treated as matching
  every host.
  (Martin Pool, #586341)

* Plugins incompatible with the current version of bzr no longer produce a
  warning on every command invocation. Instead, a message is shown by
  ``bzr plugins`` and in crash reports.
  (#704195, Martin Pool)

* The "pretty" version of ``needs_read_lock`` and ``needs_write_lock`` now
  preserves the identity of default parameter values.
  (Andrew Bennetts, #718569)

* ``bzr dump-btree --raw`` no longer tracebacks on a B-Tree file
  containing no rows. (Eric Siegerman, #715508)

* Fix ``bzr lp-mirror`` to work on command line branch URLs and branches
  without an explicit public location. (Max Bowsher)

* On Python 2.6 and higher, use multiprocessing.cpu_count() to retrieve the
  number of available processors. (Jelmer Vernooij, #693140)

API Changes
***********

* Added ``Branch.heads_to_fetch`` method. Implementions of the Branch API
  must now inherit or implement this method. (Andrew Bennetts, #721328)

* Added ``bzrlib.mergetools`` module with helper functions for working with
  the list of external merge tools. (Gordon Tyler, #489915)

* All methods and arguments that were deprecated before 2.0
  have been removed. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Branch formats should now be registered on the format registry
  (``bzrlib.branch.format_registry``) rather than using the class
  methods on ``BranchFormat``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #714729)

* ``BranchFormat.supports_leaving_lock()`` and
  ``RepositoryFormat.supports_leaving_lock`` flags have been added.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Branch.fetch`` implementations must now accept an optional
  ``fetch_spec`` keyword argument. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``Branch.import_last_revision_info`` is deprecated. Use the
  ``import_last_revision_info_and_tags`` method instead.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``ControlDirFormat.register_format`` has been removed. Instead,
  ``Prober`` implementations should now implement a ``known_formats``
  method. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzrlib.revionspec.dwim_revspecs`` is deprecated.
  Use ``bzrlib.revisionspec.RevisionSpec_dwim.append_possible_revspec`` and
  ``bzrlib.revisionspec.RevisionSpec_dwim.append_possible_lazy_revspec``
  instead. (Jelmer Vernooij, #721971)

* ``BzrDirFormat`` has a new attribute ``fixed_components`` that
  indicates whether the components of the bzrdir can be upgraded
  independent of the ``BzrDir``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``BzrProber.register_format`` and ``BzrProber.unregister_format`` are
  now deprecated in favour of the ``BzrProber.formats`` format registry.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``ControlDir`` implementations no longer have to provide the
  ``get_branch_transport``, ``get_workingtree_transport`` and
  ``get_repository_transport`` methods. (Jelmer Vernooij, #730325)

* ``Converter`` has been moved from ``bzrlib.bzrdir`` to
  ``bzrlib.controldir``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Repository formats can now provide
  ``_get_extra_interrepo_test_combinations`` in the same module
  to provide extra test combinations for ``bzrlib.tests.per_repository``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Repository formats should now be registered on the format registry
  (``bzrlib.repository.format_registry``) rather than using the class
  methods on ``RepositoryFormat``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Repository formats can now indicate they do not support the full
  VersionedFiles API by setting the ``supports_full_versioned_files``
  attribute to False. A subset of the VersionedFiles API
  (signatures and text graphs) still needs to be supported.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Repository formats have a new method ``is_deprecated`` that
  implementations can override to return True to trigger a deprecation
  warning. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The ``revision_id`` parameter of
  ``Repository.search_missing_revision_ids`` and
  ``InterRepository.search_missing_revision_ids`` is deprecated. It is
  replaced by the ``revision_ids`` parameter. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Working tree formats should now be registered on the format registry
  (``bzrlib.working_tree.format_registry``) rather than using the class
  methods on ``WorkingTreeFormat``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #714730)

Internals
*********

* ``CatchingExceptionThread`` (formerly ThreadWithException) has been moved
  out of the ``bzrlib.tests`` hierarchy to make it clearer that it can be used
  outside of tests. This class makes it easier to track exceptions in threads
  by cacthing them so they can be re-raised in the controlling thread. It's
  available in the ``bzrlib.cethread`` module. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``HookPoint.lazy_hook`` and ``Hooks.install_named_lazy_hook`` can install
  hooks for which the callable is loaded lazily. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Testing
*******

* The Range parsing for HTTP requests will correctly parse incomplete ranges.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #731240)

On behalf og QBzr developers I'm happy to announce first beta of
upcoming 0.21 release. QBzr 0.21 is intended to be companion release
for bzr 2.4, and compatible with bzr 2.3.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
(Short tour over some of new features:
http://bazaarvcs.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/qbzr-0-21-beta1-new-features/)

qdiff window has been reworked and all controls moved to a toolbar,
similar to one in qannotate window. Also qdiff toolbar provides you
new functions: text search within active pane and also knob to ignore
whitespace changes (it's also available as command-line option).

User can configure the tab width and this setting affects qdiff,
qannotate and qcat windows. By default tab width equals to 8
characters, user can set new default value in bazaar.conf as
``tab_width = N`` (either via qconfig or editing [DEFAULT] section of
bazaar.conf). Also user can set individual tab width for branches in
their branch.conf.

Other changes include major rework of qinfo dialog (show the same
information as CLI ``bzr info`` does), qcommit dialog now remembers
state of "Show non-versioned" knob between runs, and several other
improvements and bugfixes (see full changelog for details).

Full changelog can be seen on the release page:
https://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.21/0.21b1 and in NEWS.txt file in
branch/sources tarball.

On behalf of the Bazaar Explorer Developers I'm glad to announce new
release of Bazaar Explorer 1.1.3. This is mostly bug fix release, and
it's intended to be used with bzr 2.3-2.4 (and I hope it works with
bzr 2.2 at least), and with qbzr 0.20-0.21 (0.19).

Changelog
---------
New features:

* By default try to delete unversioned paths by sending them to trash
(with
  help of cross-platform library ``send2trash``). User can force the
old method
  (simply kill paths) by changing option in Tools - Options - Behavior
- Actions
  dialog. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #628561)

Bug Fixes:

* Rather than displaying an error saying "Invalid url supplied to
transport"
  branches with non-ascii characters in the directory name can now be
opened.
  (Martin [gz], #777860)

* Workaround for bug with losing changes in qbzr.conf: reset internal
cache for
  qbzr config file after we restore size of explorer window.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #761535)

Translations:

* Bulgarian translation added.

Hi all,

We've got a new stable release: 2.3.3

2.3.2 has been skipped due to an issue in the release process, so don't
search for it ;)

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users on
earlier 2.3 releases.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.3/2.3.3/ as a source tarball; packages for
various systems are or will be available soon.

bzr 2.3.3
#########

:2.3.3: 2011-05-13

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This fixed a bug in the test suite triggered by python-2.7 deprecating some
tests helpers.

Testing
*******

* Stop using `failIf`, `failUnless`, `failIfEqual`, etc, that give
  `PendingDeprecationWarnings` on Python2.7. 
  (Martin Pool, #760435)


bzr 2.3.2
#########

:2.3.2: 2011-05-12

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This was never released due to bug #760435 interrupting the release process by
breaking the test suite under python-2.7 on natty.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None

New Features
************

None

Improvements
************

* Getting all entries from ``CHKInventory.iter_entries_by_dir()`` has been
  sped up dramatically for large trees. Iterating by dir is not the best
  way to load data from a CHK inventory, so it preloads all the items in
  the correct order. (With the gcc-tree, this changes it (re)reading 8GB
  of CHK data, down to just 150MB.) This has noticeable affects for things
  like building checkouts, etc.  (John Arbash Meinel, #737234)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar now infers the default user email address on Unix from the local
  account name plus the contents of ``/etc/mailname`` if that file exists.
  In particular, this means that committing as root through etckeeper will
  normally not require running ``bzr whoami`` first.
  (Martin Pool, #616878)

* ``bzr merge --preview --pull`` should respect the ``--preview`` option
  first, and not actually change the branch tip revision.
  (John Arbash Meinel, Dennis Duchier, #760152)

* ``bzr push`` into a repository (that doesn't have a branch), will no
  longer copy all revisions in the repository. Only the ones in the
  ancestry of the source branch, like it does in all other cases.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #465517)

* Fix ``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'lock_url' in wait_lock`` error,
  especially while trying to save configuration from QBzr.
  (Martin Pool, #733136)

* Fix "Unable to obtain lock" error when pushing to a bound branch if tags
  had changed.  Bazaar was attempting to open and lock the master branch
  twice in this case.  (Andrew Bennetts, #733350)

* Standalone bzr.exe installation on Windows: user can put additional python 
  libraries into ``site-packages`` subdirectory of the installation directory,
  this might be required for "installing" extra dependencies for some plugins.
  (Alexander Belchenko, #743256)

* When reporting a crash without apport, don't print the full list of
   plugins because it's often too long.
   (Martin Pool, #716389)

API Changes
***********

None.

Testing
*******

* FreeBSD8 has switched to python-2.7 which revealed a re-occurrence of a test
  failure in the launchpad plugin. ``xmlrpclib.py`` on natty carries a patch
  that is not in python-2.7 upstream and masked the issue. An additional fix
  has been added in the interim
  (<http://psf.upfronthosting.co.za/roundup/tracker/issue8194> should be fixed
  in python > 2.7.1).  (Vincent Ladeuil, #654733)

Hi,

My name is vila and... err, wrong channel.

We have a new beta release: the third one in the 2.4 series (2.4.0 is
planned to be released in August 2011).

Our beta releases are suitable for everyday use but you may encounter
small incompatibilities with some plugins. 

Since this is our third beta, most of them have already been addressed
though; so file bugs for the remaining ones !

All fixes done on our previous stable releases are included (it's always
the case but it's worth reminding).

I'm happy to thank everyone who contributed to this release whether you
sent merge proposals, patches, suggestions and feedback, this is much
appreciated, keep them coming !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4b3/ as a source tarball.

Installers have been built in record time after the source freeze for
windows and OSX.

Packages for Ubuntu are available in the beta ppa:
https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive/beta

Note that we've stopped supporting python-2.4/2.5 and hardy there for
the *beta*, the 2.3 stable series will maintain compatibility with
python2.4.

And now for the gory details:


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* ``bzr-2.4`` has officially dropped support for python2.4 and python2.5.
  We will continue to maintain ``bzr-2.3`` for people who still need to
  use those versions of python. (John Arbash Meinel)

New Features
************

* The text compressor used for 2a repositories now has a tweakable
  parameter that can be set in bazaar.conf.
  ``bzr.groupcompress.max_entries_per_source`` default of 65536.
  When doing compression, we build up an index of locations to match
  against. Setting this higher will result in slightly better compression,
  at a cost of more memory. Note that a value of 65k represents fully
  sampling a 1MB file. So this only has an effect when compressing texts
  larger than N*16 bytes. (John Arbash Meinel, #602614)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr branch --stacked`` from a smart server uses the network a little
  more efficiently. For a simple branch it reduces the number of
  round-trips by about 20%. (Andrew Bennetts)

* ``bzr log --line`` scales the width of the author field with the size of
  the line. This means that the full author name is shown when the
  environment variable BZR_COLUMNS=0. (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* ``bzr pull`` now properly triggers the fast
  ``CHKInventory.iter_changes`` rather than the slow generic
  inter-Inventory changes. It used to use a ``DirStateRevisionTree`` as
  one of the source trees, which is faster when we have to read the whole
  inventory anyway, but much slower when we can get just the delta out of
  the repository. On a 70k record tree, this changes ``bzr pull`` from 28s
  down to 17s. (John Arbash Meinel, #780677)

* Slightly reduced memory consumption when fetching into a 2a repository
  by reusing existing caching a little better. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Speed up ``bzr status`` by a little bit when there are a couple of
  modified files. We now track how many files we have seen that need
  updating, and only rewrite the dirstate file if enough of them have
  changed. The default is 10, and can be overridden by setting the branch
  option "``bzr.workingtree.worth_saving_limit``".
  (Ian Clatworthy, John Arbash Meinel, #380202)

* Speed up ``bzr uncommit``. Instead of resetting the dirstate from
  scratch, use ``update_basis_by_delta``, computing the delta from the
  repository. (John Arbash Meinel, #780544)

Bug Fixes
*********

* All Tree types can now be exported as tar.*, zip or directories.
  (Aaron Bentley)

* ``bzr merge --no-remember location`` never sets ``submit_branch``.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #782169)

* ``bzr pull --no-remember location`` never sets
  ``parent_location``. ``bzr push --no-remember location`` never
  sets ``push_location``. ``bzr send --no-remember
  submit_location public_location`` never sets ``submit_branch``
  nor ``public_branch``. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Conflicts involving non-ascii filenames are now properly reported rather
  than failing with a UnicodeEncodeError. (Martin [GZ], #686161)

* Correct parent is now set when using 'switch -b' with bound branches.
  (A. S. Budden, #513709)

* Fix `bzr plugins` regression in bzr 2.4 which resulted in a traceback
  from writelines on ckj terminals. (Martin [GZ], #754082)

* ``WT.inventory`` and ``WT.iter_entries_by_dir()`` was not correctly
  reporting subdirectories that were tree references (in formats that
  supported them). (John Arbash Meinel, #764677)

* Merging into empty branches now gives an error as this is currently
  not supported. (Jonathan Riddell, #242175)

* Do not show exception to user on pointless commit error (Jonathan
  Riddell #317357)

* ``WT.update_basis_by_delta`` no longer requires that the deltas match
  the current WT state. This allows ``update_basis_by_delta`` to be used
  by more commands than just commit. Updating with a delta allows us to
  not load the whole inventory, which can take 10+s with large trees.
  (Jonathan Riddell, John Arbash Meinel, #781168)

Documentation
*************

* Restore the workaround for option names including dots (--1.14) which was
  disabled when we stopped listing --1.9 as a format.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #782289)

API Changes
***********

* ``annotate_file`` has been deprecated in favor of
  ``annotate_file_revision_tree``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #775598)

* ``Branch.fetch`` now takes an optional ``limit`` argument.
  (Andrew Bennetts, Jelmer Vernooij, #750175)

* ``Inter.get`` now raises ``NoCompatibleInter`` if there are no
  compatible optimisers rather than an instance of the class it is called
  on. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Branch.push`` now takes a ``lossy`` argument.
  ``Branch.lossy_push`` has been removed.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``Repository.get_file_graph`` which can return the
  per-file revision graph. (Jelmer Vernooij, #775578)

* The default implementation of ``Branch`` is now oriented to
  storing the branch tip. Branch implementations which store the full
  history should now subclass ``FullHistoryBzrBranch``.
  ``Branch._last_revision_info`` has been renamed to
  ``Branch._read_last_revision_info`` (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Tree.__iter__`` has been deprecated; use ``Tree.all_file_ids``
  instead. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Tree.get_symlink_target`` now takes an optional ``path``
  argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

* Removed ``bzrlib.branch._run_with_write_locked_target`` as
  ``bzrlib.cleanup`` provides the same functionality in a more general
  way. (Andrew Bennetts)

Testing
*******

* A test that was expected to fail but passes instead now counts as a failure
  catching up with new testtools and subunit handling. (Martin [GZ], #654474)

* Make it easier for plugins to reuse the per_workingtree scenarios by
  restoring the wt_scenarios helper that was accidentally deleted.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #783472)

* Removed ``test_breakin`` tests that were excessively prone to hanging,
  did not work on Wine, and partly already disabled.
  (Martin Pool, #408814, #746985)

* Windows locations are different and should be tested accordingly.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #788131)

Hi,

A new beta release, our fourth one, has been released: 2.4b4. 2.4.0 is
planned to be released in August 2011.

As usual, this contains all known bug fixes (including the ones we made
for the previous stable releases).

Thanks to all participants, whether you sent merge proposals, comments,
suggestions and feedback, we very much appreciate all of them.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4b4/ as a source tarball.

Installers have been built in record time after the source freeze for
windows and the OSX ones will hopefully be available soon.

2.4b4 is available in Debian sid (unstable) and packages for Ubuntu are
available in the beta ppa: https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive/beta

Reminder: since 2.4b3, we've stopped supporting python-2.4/2.5 and hardy
there for the *beta*, the 2.3 stable series will maintain compatibility
with python2.4.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Quickly after the beta was made available on debian sid
    we had two reports of http://pad.lv/799212 . The fix has already
    landed on trunk and will be available in 2.4b5. It impacts anybody
    with a bazaar.conf containing some non-ascii chars but only when no
    BZR_EDITOR environment variable is set. So the workaround is to set
    BZR_EDITOR to a valid editor.

We'll have another (and last) beta before the final 2.4.0 release. If
you're a plugin author, please make sure you have a clearly identified
released compatible with 2.4 (preferably with a dedicated series like
http://pad.lv/p/qbzr does or at least a tag for the version you'd like
to be carried by the installers and the ppas). Whatever you decide, keep
in touch with the packagers or just reply to this mail. There is no
urgency (yet ;) but you'll get better feedback if your planned release
can be packaged with 2.4b5 (expected to be frozen 2011-07-07).

And now for the gory details:

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* Do not treat configuration option 'check_signatures = require' as if
  it were 'create_signatures = always' (Jonathan Riddell)

New Features
************

* Hooks have been added for config stacks: ``get``, ``set`` and ``remove``
  are called when an option is respectively read, modified or deleted. Also
  added ``load`` and ``save`` hooks for config stores, called when the
  stores are loaded or saved. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* New hook server_exception in bzrlib.smart.server to catch any
  exception caused while running bzr serve.
  (Jonathan Riddell, #274578)

* New hook set_commit_message in bzrlib.msgeditor to set
  a commit message and revision properties. (Jonathan Riddell,
  #274578)

* Support ``-S`` as an alias for ``--short`` for the ``log`` and
  ``missing`` commands. (Martin von Gagern, #38655)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr annotate`` can be run without setting whoami data first. (Jonathan
  Riddell, #667408)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Bazaar can now detect when a lock file is held by a dead process
  originating from the same machine, and steal the lock after printing a
  message to the user. This is off by default, for safety, but can be
  turned on by setting the configuration variable ``locks.steal_dead`` to
  ``True``.
  (Martin Pool, #220464)

* Credentials in the log output produced by ``-Dhttp`` are masked so users
  can more freely post them in bug reports. (Vincent Ladeuil, #723074)

* Fix a race condition for ``server_started`` hooks leading to a spurious
  test failure. (Vincent Ladeuil, #789167)

* Fix exporting subdirectory with ``--per-file-timestamps``.
  (Szilveszter Farkas, #795557)

* Handle files that get created but don't get used during TreeTransform.
  ``open()`` can create a file, and still raise an exception before it
  returns. So anything we might have created, make sure we destroy during
  ``finalize()``. (Martin [gz], #597686)

* ``pack_repo`` now uses ``Transport.move`` instead of
  ``Transport.rename``, deleting any existing targets even on SFTP.
  (Martin von Gagern, #421776)

* Pass the ``build_mo`` command to the rest of the setup() calls in
  setup.py. The ``bdist_wininst`` and ``py2exe`` code paths were failing
  because ``build_mo`` became a required step that they didn't know about.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #787122)

* Properly avoid re-adding a file after it changes case on CICP
  filesystems. (John Arbash Meinel, #798130)

* Reports the original error when an InvalidHttpResponse exception is
  encountered to facilitate debug. (Vincent Ladeuil, #788530)

* Reports a non-existant file error when trying to merge in a file
  that does not exist. (Jonathan Riddell, #330063)

* ``UIFactory.prompt``, ``UIFactory.get_username``,
  ``UIFactory.get_password`` and ``UIFactory.get_boolean`` now require a
  unicode prompt to be passed in. (Jelmer Vernooij, #592083)

* Support merging into the empty tree. (Aaron Bentley, #595328)

Documentation
*************

* Improve documentation of ``bzr merge --force``.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #767307)

* Make docs for configuration options for digital signatures match
  reality. (Jonathan Riddell)

* Add user-guide page on GPG signatures. (Jonathan Riddell)

API Changes
***********

* Information about held lockdir locks returned from eg `LockDir.peek` is
  now represented as a `LockHeldInfo` object, rather than a plain
  Python dict.
  (Martin Pool)

* Remove `file_status` function.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``Repository.iter_reverse_revision_history`` is now deprecated.
  Use ``Graph.iter_lefthand_ancestry`` instead.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #739481)

Internals
*********

* ``tools/check-newsbugs.py`` accepts a ``--browser`` option to open
  corresponding launchpad pages in a browser. (Vincent Ladeuil)

Testing
*******

* A `ImportTariffTestCase` base class has been added in
  ``bzrlib.tests.test_import_tariff``, which can be used for import tariff
  tests in plugins. (Jelmer Vernooij, #793465)

* Fix deadlock in `TestImportTariffs.test_simple_serve` when stderr gets
  more output than fits in the default buffer. This was happening on the
  Windows buildslave, and could easily happen in other circumstances where
  the default OS buffer size for pipes is small or the ``python -v``
  output is large. (Andrew Bennetts, #784802)

* Fix spurious test failure on OSX for WorkingTreeFormat2.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #787942)

* Re-target ``bb.test_merge.TestMerge.test_merge_reversed_revision_range``
  and rewrite it as a parametrized test to avoid unrelated failures.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #795456)

* Show log file contents from subprocesses started by
  `start_bzr_subprocess` in test failure details. This may help diagnose
  strange hangs and failures involving subprocesses. (Andrew Bennetts)

* Skip ``utextwrap`` tests when ``sphinx`` breaks text_wrap by an hostile
  monkeypatch to textwrap.TextWrapper.wordsep_re.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #785098)

* Multiple ``selftest --exclude`` options are now combined instead of
  overriding each other. (Vincent Ladeuil, #746991)

* Restore some ``FTPTransport`` test coverage by allowing ``pyftpdlib
  0.6.0`` to be used. Also restore ``medusa`` support while leaving it
  disabled to make it easier to use if/when we can in the future.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #781140)

* `TestImportTariffs` no longer uses the real ``$HOME``. This prevents it
  from polluting ``$HOME/.bzr.log`` or being accidentally influenced by
  user configuration such as aliases. It still runs with all the user's
  plugins enabled, as intended.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, Andrew Bennetts, #789505)

I've just released Bazaar Explorer 1.1.4. This is maintenance release, 
and it will be mostly interested for windows users of Bazaar Explorer.
Now windows installer for Bazaar Explorer has send2trash library bundled.

Official standalone windows installer for 2.4b5 and higher should have 
the same fix soon.

Hi,

Our fifth and **last** beta has been released: 2.4b5.

2.4.0 is planned to be released in August 2011.

2.4b5 contains all known bug fixes (including the ones we made for the
previous stable releases).

Thanks to all participants, whether you sent merge proposals, comments,
suggestions and feedback, we very much appreciate all of them.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4b4/ as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows and OSX.

Reminder for people trying their first 2.4beta: since 2.4b3, we've
stopped supporting python-2.4/2.5 (including Ubuntu Hardy) for the
*betas*, the 2.3 stable series will maintain compatibility with
python2.4.

If you're a plugin author, please make sure you have a clearly
identified release compatible with 2.4 (preferably with a dedicated
series like http://pad.lv/p/qbzr does or at least a tag for the version
you'd like to be to carried by the installers and the ppas).

Whatever you decide, keep in touch with the packagers or just reply to
this mail. There is no urgency but on the other hand packagers may not
be able to carry the right version of your plugin when 2.4.0 will be
packaged. The bzr API is frozen for the 2.4 series so what works today
for your plugin should still work for 2.4.0, don't rush new features
(you'll be able to do minor releases for the 2.4 series, but if you have
a working version, just release it ;).

And now for the gory details:

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.

New Features
************

* New command ``verify-signatures`` to check if all commits or specified co=
mmits
  have digital signatures from trusted keys.  Requires python-gpgme to be
  installed.

* New option ``--signatures`` for ``bzr log`` to display digital signature
  verification results for each commit.

* Config option acceptable_keys to list which GPG keys are verified as trus=
ted.

* Config option validate_signatures_in_log to always show signatures in=20
  ``bzr log``.

Improvements
************

* ``Branch.open`` is now about 3x faster (about 2ms instead of 6.5ms).
  (Andrew Bennetts).

Bug Fixes
*********

* Display a proper error message when a config file content cannot be
  decoded as UTF-8 or when it cannot be parsed.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #502060, #688677, #797246)

* Generate a single conflict (instead of two) when merging a branch
  modifying and renaming a file in a branch that deleted it (or vice-versa).
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #688101)

* Give a more helpful message when the bzr executable doesn't match the
  library.  (This typically happens because of a misconfigured PYTHONPATH
  or half-installed bzr.)=20=20
  (Martin Pool, #804553)

* Properly load utf8-encoded config files. (Vincent Ladeuil, #799212)

* ``GraphThunkIdsToKeys.merge_sort`` now properly returns
  keys rather than ids. (Jelmer Vernooij, #799677)

* ``TreeTransformBase.fixup_new_roots`` can now check that a tree root
  is present. (Jelmer Vernooij, #801257)

API Changes
***********

* New attributes ``WorkingTreeFormat.supports_versioned_directories`` and
  ``RepositoryFormat.supports_versioned_directories``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #765815)

* The "revno" field type when using the python version-info format is now
  a string (to handle dotted revnos) (Beno=EEt Pierre, #796259)

Internals
*********

* Start implementing localization, starting with command help text (but not
  the command options themselves). This will allow bootstrapping the bzr
  internationalization process. (Inada Naoki)

Testing
*******

* Fix test failures when running as a homeless user (debian buildd). Tests
  leaking into ``${HOME}/.bzr.log`` should be detected properly now.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #798698)

1 new stable release: 2.3.4 ;)

This is a bugfix release and upgrading is recommended for all users of
earlier 2.3 releases.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed feedback, suggestions, bug
reports and patches !


Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.3/2.3.4 as a source tarball.

On the same URL you'll also find installers for windows and OSX.

Packages for Ubuntu are available from the stable PPA,
https://launchpad.net/~bzr/+archive/ppa

The SRU process for natty is underway so regular users should also get
their update soon.

FreeBSD ports have been upgraded too.

More details below:

bzr 2.3.4
#########

:2.3.4: 2011-07-14

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier
2.3 releases.

This mainly fixes bug #786980 which blocked the SRU process for Ubuntu Natty.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.

Bug Fixes
*********

* Accept some differences for ``bound_location`` from the config files that
  were leading to a 'ReadOnlyError: A write attempt was made in a read only
  transaction' error. (Vincent Ladeuil, #786980)

* Don't fail with traceback if `bzr serve` is running as a service on Windows,
  and there is no USERNAME, nor BZR_EMAIL or other whoami-related environment
  variables set. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #660174)

Documentation
*************

* Updated the "Using stacked branches" section of the user guide to
  describe committing to stacked branches and expanded its discussion of
  pushing a stacked branch. (Andrew Bennetts)

Testing
*******

* Remove the deprecation decorators for ``failUnlessExists`` and
  ``failIfExists``. The deprecation "will" occur in 2.4, not
  before. Providing the wrappers is enough as far as 2.3 is concerned.
  (Vincent Ladeuil #794960)

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of
QBzr 0.21 codenamed "Tilia".

This release intended to be used as companion release for bzr 2.4, and 
might support bzr 2.3.

I'd like to thank the people who have helped make this release awesome. 
Thank you.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
QBzr 0.21 is companion release for bzr 2.4, and compatible with bzr 2.3.
New features in this release:

Now you can select changes to shelve and unshelve your saved changes 
with new shiny qshelve and qunshelve dialogs.

qdiff window has been reworked and all controls moved to a toolbar, 
similar to one in qannotate window. Also qdiff toolbar provides you new 
functions: text search within active pane and also knob to ignore 
whitespace changes (it's also available as command-line option).

User can configure the tab width and this setting affects qdiff, 
qannotate and qcat windows. By default tab width equals to 8 characters, 
user can set new default value in bazaar.conf as ``tab_width = N`` 
(either via qconfig or editing [DEFAULT] section of bazaar.conf). Also 
user can set individual tab width for branches in their branch.conf. 
User can configure tab width via "View Options" menu in toolbars of 
qdiff, qannotate.

QBzr provides support for new builtin feature of bzr: mergetools. Now 
you can easier configure your favorite diff/merge tool to be used from 
qconflicts or context menu in qbrowse (Working Tree browser in Bazaar 
Explorer).

If you have python-gpgme installed and you have enabled gpg-signatures 
for your commits then you can see new messages regarding valid 
gpg-signatures available in qlog. Also you can run check of your 
signatures with new qverify-signatures command.

Other changes include major rework of qinfo dialog (show the same 
information as CLI ``bzr info`` does), qcommit dialog now remembers 
state of "Show non-versioned" knob between runs, now it's possible to 
save old state of the file from qlog dialog (using context menu in file 
list), error dialogs has been improved (now also support apport if 
available) and several other improvements and bugfixes (see full 
changelog for details at the end of this mail).

Changelog
---------
Changes after 0.21 beta 1:

  * qcat:
    * Fixed problem with viewing file from qbrowse.
      (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #776196)
  * qinfo:
    * Turned off word-wrap in location label: prevents strange
      path display if there are spaces in the path.
      (A. S. Budden, Bug #781040)
    * Fixed UnicodeError for non-ascii paths.
      (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #790138)
  * qdiff, qannotate:
    * Tab-width can be customised from the view menu.
      (Bug #490377, A. S. Budden)
  * qgetnew:
    * The target location no longer gets overwritten
      when the source location changes. (Andr Bachmann)
  * qlog:
    * File list context menu: added support to save content of a file
      of specific revision as a new file. (Andr Bachmann)
    * Show digital signature information for commits if python-gpgme is
      installed
  * Improved error dialogs on internal/other error,
    support for apport (if it's available).
    (Jonathan Riddell)
  * Branch/Checkout dialogs:
    * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError with non-ascii paths in target directory
      picker. (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #789083)
  * Use bzrlib.mergetools for managing and using external merge tools in 
qconfig
    and qconflicts. (Bug #489915, Gordon Tyler)
  * New qshelve / qunshelve dialogs. (IWATA Hidetaka)
  * New command qverify-signatures to show digital signature statuses
    for branch commits

Changes in 0.21 beta 1:

  * qbranch:
    * Fixed problem with very small width of input fields in the dialog
      on Mac OSX. (Timothy Reaves, Bug #667090)
  * qbrowse:
    * Use `qcat --native` equivalent to allow opening copies of files from
      branches without working trees. (A. S. Budden, Bug #752422)
  * qcommit:
    * Remember "Show non-versioned" checkbox state.
      (Nick Sonneveld, Bug #258926)
  * qconflicts:
    * Fixed internal error when there is conflict in non-versioned file.
      (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #655451)
  * qdiff:
    * New toolbar with controls and options (similar to qannotate's 
toolbar).
      (Dorin Scutarau)
    * Support for ignore whitespace differences in changes.
      This mode can be turned on from command-line (`qdiff -w`
      or `qdiff --ignore-whitespace`) and from GUI itself (in View Options).
      (Dorin Scutarau, Glen Mailer, Bug #642000)
    * Added Find action to do text search within either pane.
      (Dorin Scutarau, Bug #497832)
  * qinfo:
    * Significantly simpler implementation that shows the information
      provided by Bazaar.  This fills in the gaps in the data shown
      by qinfo (such as details of checkouts) and means that changes
      to 'bzr info' will automatically be reflected in qinfo.
      (A. S. Budden, Bug #439624)
  * qsubprocess:
    * Reliable exception encoding to pass exception attributes
      from subprocess to the GUI process. (Martin [gz], Bug #686735)
  * qannotate, qdiff:
    * Find text box turns red if no matches are found.
      (A. S. Budden, Bug #772244)
  * qcat, qannotate, qdiff, qconfig:
    * Added ability to customise the tab-stop width (setting in qconfig,
      affects qcat, qannotate and qdiff).
      The setting is stored in [DEFAULT] section of bazaar.conf,
      and is named tab_width (it can also be configured with qconfig). 
Units
      are characters (so 4 means a tab should be displayed with the 
width of 4
      spaces).  The default value is 8.  The setting can also be adjusted in
      branch.conf for specific branches.  (Bug #490377, A. S. Budden)

On behalf of the Bazaar team and community, I'm happy to announce
availability of a new release of the bzr adaptive version control
system.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is part of the GNU system
<http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4.0 as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows and OSX from the url above too.

This release marks the start of another long-term-stable series. From
here, we will only make bugfix releases on the 2.4 series (2.4.1, etc,
and support it until February 2013), while 2.5 will become our new
development series.

This is a bugfix and polish release over the 2.3 series, with a large number
of bugs fixed (>150 for the 2.4 series alone), and some performance
improvements. Support for python 2.4 and 2.5 has been dropped, many large
working tree operations have been optimized as well as some stacked branches
operations.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.

See
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/whats-new/whats-new-in-2.4.html
for more details,

      Vincent

Hi all,

Here comes our new stable release: 2.4.1

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is part of the GNU project
<http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

After the slight delay for the 2.4.0 release, we're back on our regular
release schedule.

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users on
earlier 2.4 releases.

2.4.1 contains all known bug fixes for all stable releases (including
the ones we made for the previous stable series).

Thanks to all participants, whether you sent merge proposals, comments,
suggestions and feedback, we very much appreciate all of them.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4b4/ as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows from the url above, OSX ones are on
their way.

2.4.1 has also been uploaded to debian and ubuntu.

The detailed changelog is available below,

    Vincent


Bug Fixes
*********

* ``config.LocationMatcher`` properly excludes unrelated sections.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #829237)

* ``dirstate.fdatasync`` and ``repository.fdatasync`` can now properly be
  disabled. (Vincent Ladeuil, #824513)

* Disable ``os.fsync`` and ``os.fdatasync`` by default when running
  ``bzr selftest``. You can use ``--sync`` to re-enable them.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #837293)

* Fix i18n use when no environment variables are set. (Jelmer Vernooij, #810701)

* Avoid UnicodeDecode error when reporting EINVAL from transports.
  (IWATA Hidetaka, #829237)

Documentation
*************

* Corrected documentation for BZR_PROGRESS_BAR.
  (Dennis Benzinger, #735417)

Testing
*******

* The test suite should now be able to run under weird environments where
  ``/etc/passwd`` doesn't contain the ``uid`` for the user running selftest
  or where ``fakeroot`` is used but ``/root`` is inacessible.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #825027)

Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the first beta for the 2.5 series: 2.5b1.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

2.5.0 is planned to be released in February 2012.

2.5b1 contains all know bug fixes including the ones made for the
previous stable releases.

A warm thank you to all people that send feedback, suggestions, even
merge proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5b1/ as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows and OSX and packages are on their
way for the usual GNU/Linux distributions that propose our beta releases
as well as the beta PPA for Ubuntu.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None

New Features
************

* A ``from_unicode`` parameter can be specified when registering a config
  option. This implements boolean, integer and list config options when the
  provided ``bool_from_store``, ``int_from_store`` and ``list_from_store``
  are used for this parameter. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Accessing a packaging branch on Launchpad (eg, ``lp:ubuntu/bzr``) now
  checks to see if the most recent published source package version for
  that project is present in the branch tags. This should help developers
  trust whether the packaging branch is up-to-date and can be used for new
  changes. The level of verbosity is controlled by the config item
  ``launchpad.packaging_verbosity``. It can be set to one of

  off
    disable all checks

  minimal
    only display if the branch is out-of-date

  short
    also display single-line up-to-date and missing,

  all
    (default) display multi-line content for all states

  (John Arbash Meinel, #609187, #812928)

* Add a config option gpg_signing_key for setting which GPG key should
  be used to sign commits. Also default to using the gpg user identity
  which matches user_email() as set by whoami.
  (Jonathan Riddell, #68501)

* An ``invalid`` parameter can be specified when registering a config option
  to decide what should be done when invalid values are
  encountered. 'warning' and 'error' will respectively emit a warning and
  ignore the value or errors out. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* bzr add now skips large files in recursive mode. The default "large"
  size is 20MB, and is configurable via the add.maximum_file_size
  option. A value of 0 disables skipping. Named items passed to add are
  never skipped. (Shannon Weyrick, #54624)

* ``bzr help configuration/<option>`` display the help for ``option`` for
  all registered configuration options. (Vincent Ladeuil, #747050)

* ``bzr log -m`` now matches message, author, committer and bugs instead
  of just matching the message. ``--message`` keeps its original meaning,
  while ``--match-message, --match-author, --match-committer`` and
  ``--match-bugs`` match each of those fields. (Jacek Sieka)

* ``config.Option`` can now declare ``default_from_env``, a list of
  environment variables to get a default value from. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ``config.NameMatcher`` can be used to implement config stores and stacks
  that need to provide specific option values for arbitrary unique IDs (svn
  repository UUIDs, etc). (Vincent Ladeuil, #843638)

* New builtin ``bzr branches`` command, which lists all colocated branches
  in a directory. (Jelmer Vernooij, #826820)

* Relative local paths can now be specified in URL syntax by using the
  "file:" prefix. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Report commits signed with expired keys in ``verify-signatures``.
  (Jonathan Riddell, #804254)

* Translations are now enabled for command help, errors and globally
  for any message using gettext given on output. (Jonathan Riddell,
  INADA Naoki, #83941)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr add`` will now warn about nested subtrees that are skipped.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #187342)

* ``bzr commit -m ''`` can now be used to force an empty commit message.
  Entering an empty commit message in the message editor still triggers
  an error. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzr pull`` will now mention how many tags it has updated.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #164450)

* ``bzr tag`` no longer errors if a tag already exists but refers to the
  same revision, and will mention when a tag has been updated
  rather than created. (Jelmer Vernooij, #381203)

* ``bzr uncommit`` will now remove tags that refer to removed revisions.
  The ``--keep-tags`` option can be used to prevent this behaviour.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #605814)

* Do not run i18n initialisation twice. (Jonathan Riddell)

* Install translation .mo files. (Jonathan Riddell)

* Locations printed by ``bzr upgrade`` are now formatted before display.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Repository.get_parent_map`` now estimates the size of the returned
  content more accurately. This means that we get closer to the desired
  64kB/request. For repositories converted from svn, this can be an
  improvement of approx 5:1 in round trips to discover the whole history.
  (John Arbash Meinel)

* Support a ``bugtracker`` option which is used by ``bzr commit --fixes``
  if no bug tracker was specified on the command line.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #334860)

* Use gettext.NullTranslations in i18n to allow use of i18n even when
  translations are not turned on. (Jonathan Riddell)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr commit`` now correctly reports missing files as "removed", not
  "modified". (Jelmer Vernooij, #553955)

* ``bzr reconfigure`` will now allow multiple non-conflicting requests
  in a single invocation, e.g. ``--branch`` and ``--use-shared``.
  (Martin von Gagern, #842993)

* A call to CHKInventory's filter-method will not result in a
  DuplicateFileId error, if you move a subfolder and change a file in
  that subfolder.
  (Bastian Bowe, #809901)

* Branching from a stacked branch no longer does a ``get_parent_map``
  request for each revisions that is in the stacked-on repository while
  determining what revisions need to be fetched. This mostly impacts
  branching initialy into an empty shared repository when the source is
  not the development focus. (John Arbash Meinel, #388269)

* Decode ``BZR_HOME`` with fs encoding on posix platforms to avoid unicode
  errors. (Vincent Ladeuil, #822571)

* Fix fallout from URL handling changes in 2.5 that caused an IndexError to be
  raised whenever a transport at the drive root was opened on windows.
  (Martin [gz], #841322)

* Fixed loading of external merge tools from config to properly decode
  command-lines which contain embedded quotes. (Gordon Tyler, #828803)

* Rather than an error being raised, a warning is now printed when the
  current user does not have permission to read a configuration file.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #837324)

* The pull command will now always use separate connections for the
  case where the destination is a heavyweight checkout of some remote
  branch on the same host as the source branch.
  (Martin von Gagern, #483661)

* TreeTransformBase.fixup_new_roots no longer forces trees to have a root, so
  operations that use it, like merge, can now create trees without a root.
  (Aaron Bentley)

Documentation
*************

* Release instructions refreshed. (Vincent Ladeuil)

API Changes
***********

* ``BranchFormat.initialize`` now takes a ``append_revisions_only``
  argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Branch._get_checkout_format`` now takes a ``lightweight`` argument
  which indicates if the format should be for a lightweight or a
  heavyweight checkout. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``ControlDir.create_branch`` now takes a ``append_revisions_only`` argument.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New class ``URL`` in ``bzrlib.utils`` for managing parsed URLs.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``Config.get_user_option_as_int_from_SI`` added for expanding a
  value in SI format (i.e. "20MB", "1GB") into its integer equivalent.
  (Shannon Weyrick)

* New method ``InterTree.file_content_matches`` which checks that
  two files in different trees have the same contents.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``Tree.get_file_verifier`` which allows tree implementations
  to return non-sha1 checksums to verify files.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #720831)

* New methods ``get_transport_from_path`` and ``get_transport_from_url``
  have been added that only support opening from a path or a URL,
  unlike ``get_transport``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New registry ``OptionRegistry`` specialized for configuration options.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``AtomicFile.closed`` which has been deprecated in bzr 0.10.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``commands._builtin_commands``, ``commands.shlex_split_unicode``,
  ``Command._maybe_expand_globs`` and ``Command.run_direct`` deprecated in
  2.10 and 2.2.0. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``diff.get_trees_and_branches_to_diff`` deprecated in 2.2.0.

* Remove ``log.calculate_view_revisions``, ``log._filter_revision_range``,
  ``log.get_view_revisions`` which have been deprecated in bzr 2.1.0. Also
  remove ``log.show_one_log`` which was never properly deprecated but wasn't
  used and is easy to inline if needed. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``trace.info``, ``trace.error`` and ``trace.show_log_error``
  deprecated in 2.1.0. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Remove ``TransportListRegistry.set_default_transport``, as the concept of
  a default transport is currently unused. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Remove ``UIFactory.warn_cross_format_fetch`` and
  ``UIFactory.warn_experimental_format_fetch`` in favor of
  ``UIFactory.show_user_warning``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Tags`` containers can now declare whether they support versioned
  tags and whether tags can refer to ghost tags.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Tags.merge_to`` now returns a dictionary with the updated tags
  and a set of conflicts, rather than just conflicts. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* There is a new class `ContentFilterTree` that provides a facade for
  content filtering. The `filtered` parameter to `export` is deprecated
  in favor of passing a filtered tree, and the specific exporter plugins
  no longer support it.
  (Martin Pool)

* ``Transport`` now has a ``_parsed_url`` attribute instead of
  separate ``_user``, ``_password``, ``_port``, ``_scheme``, ``_host``
  and ``_path`` attributes. Proxies are provided for the moment but
  may be removed in the future. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

* A new debug flag ``hpss_client_no_vfs`` will now cause the HPSS client
  to raise a ``HpssVfsRequestNotAllowed`` exception when a VFS request
  is attempted. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``ControlDir._get_selected_branch`` which returns the
  colocated branch selected using path segment parameters.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #380871)

Testing
*******

* Blackbox tests (including test scripts) can be debugged interactively (see
  bzrlib.debug.BzrPdb for details). (Vincent Ladeuil)

* `BranchBuilder.build_snapshot` now supports a "flush" action. This
  cleanly and reliably allows tests using `BranchBuilder` to construct
  branches that e.g. rename files out of a directory and unversion that
  directory in the same revision. Previously some changes were impossible
  due to the order that `build_snapshot` performs its actions.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Don't require ``os.fdatasync`` to be defined on all supported OSes
  (BSD-based OSes don't define it). (Vincent Ladeuil, #822649)

* Fix compatibility with testtools 0.9.12. (Jelmer Vernooij, #815423)

* ``LockDir`` can now be run when the local hostname is ``localhost``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #825994)

* ``ModuleAvailableFeature`` won't try to import already imported modules,
  allowing it to be used for modules with side-effects.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #712474)

* Output time stamps while running ``make check`` to get better timings from
  pqm. (Vincent Ladeuil, #837926)

* `TestCaseWithMemoryTransport` is faster now: `_check_safety_net` now
  just compares the bytes in the dirstate file to its pristine state,
  rather than opening the WorkingTree and calling ``last_revision()``.
  This reduces the overall test suite time by about 10% on my laptop.
  (Andrew Bennetts)

* Update `TestCase.knownFailure` to the testtools way of handling expected
  failures to resolve Python 2.7 incompatibility. (Martin [gz], #607400)

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 2.4.1

This version is intended to be compatible with the 2.4.x and 2.5 beta
Bazaar series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous
useful and/or frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Changes:
The main point of this release is to restore compatibility with the
2.5 beta series (Thanks, Jelmer!).  There's also a fix for a
graph-ancestry bug (Thanks, Andi Albrecht!).

I've renamed the "branches" command to "list-branches", to avoid
conflict with bzr 2.5's command.  In bzr 2.4, it can also be accessed
under the "branches" alias, so this is no major change for 2.4 users.

For more information on BzrTools, please see
http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 2.4.1 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.4.1/+download/bzrtools-2.4.1.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.4.1/+download/bzrtools-2.4.1.tar.gz.sig

Enjoy!

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce version 1.3 "Dolorous Drainpipe" of the pipeline
plugin, a tool for grouping sets of related changes into manageable
chunks.  For more information, see
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BzrPipeline or "bzr help pipeline".

This version is intended to be compatible with versions 2.2.0 to
2.5.x of Bazaar.

I discovered 1.2 was incompatible with bzr 2.2 despite claiming
compatibility, so I skipped announcing it, and made 1.3 instead.

Changes from 1.2
================

Fix compatibility with bzr 2.2.

Update the-kraken settings.

Changes from 1.1
================
Compatibility cleanups.

Lazy Loading (Jelmer).

Ignore build directory (Gary van der Mewe)

Documentation updates

Changes are unshelved when remove-pipe switches (bug #719178)

reconfigure-pipeline creates a layout compatible with bzr-colo.

Versioning now matches bzrtools-style versioning.

Refactoring.

Hi,

2.5b2 is our second beta for the 2.5 series and I'm pleased to announce
it.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

2.5.0 is planned to be released in February 2012.

2.5b2 contains all know bug fixes including the ones made for the
previous stable releases.

To wet your appetite: it includes more filtering options for ``bzr log``, idle
connections handling for ``bzr serve``, a ``development-colo`` experimental
format to flesh out the colocated branches UI, better support for foreign
formats, enhancements to the config framework and more.

A warm thank you to all people that send feedback, suggestions, even
merge proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5b2/ as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows and OSX, packages are on their way
for the usual GNU/Linux distributions that propose our beta releases as
well as the beta PPA for Ubuntu.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None

New Features
************

* A new ``-O`` standard option (common to all commands) have been added. It
  provides a value for a config option in the ``-Oname=value`` form that
  takes precedence over all definitions found in config files. It can be
  used multiple times to override different options.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #491196)

* ``bzr log`` now has an option called ``--omit-merges`` to omit
  those commits that merged branches, i.e. those having more than one
  parent.
  In order to avoid confusion, the previous command line option
  ``--include-merges`` has been renamed to ``--include-merged``.
  The old name of the command line option will still be accepted.
  The name change also affects ``bzr missing``.
  (Martin von Gagern)

* ``bzr serve`` will now disconnect clients if they have not issued an RPC
  request after 5minutes. On POSIX platforms, this will also happen for
  ``bzr serve --inet``. This can be overridden with the configuration
  variable ``serve.client_timeout`` or in the command line parameter
  ``bzr serve --client-timeout=X``. Further, it is possible to request
  ``bzr serve [--inet]`` to shutdown gracefully by sending SIGHUP. It will
  finish the current request, and then close the connection.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #824797, #795025)

* The new experimental format ``development-colo`` supports colocated
  branches. This format will eventually be merged back into the ``2a``
  format when it has stabilized and there is adequate UI support for
  colocated branches.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #831481)

Improvements
************

* Fixed a bug where ``bzr tags -r x..y`` loaded the branch history once for
  every revision in the range; it's now much faster. (Vincent Ladeuil, #857335)

* ``bzr info -v`` can now be run against branches that don't support
  ``last_revision_info``, in which case the branch information will simply
  not be displayed. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr shelve`` can now be used in emacs shells as the input handling is
  turned into a line-based one when ``INSIDE_EMACS`` is set (which is the
  case for all recent emacs versions). (Vincent Ladeuil, #856261)

* ``bzr tags`` can now be used against remote repositories that do
  not provide access to the revision graph. (Jelmer Vernooij, #858942)

* ``bzr update PATH`` will stop if you seem to be asking it to update
  anything less than a whole tree, because that's not supported by ``bzr``'s
  concept that the whole tree has a single basis revision. Previously, it
  would go ahead and update the whole tree, which was surprising.
  (Martin Pool, #557886)

* Don't crash if ``bzrlib.initialize()`` has not been called while accessing
  configs. (Vincent Ladeuil, #863401)

* Redirects between http and https no longer discard path information
  in some cases. (Jelmer Vernooij, #853765)

* The ``--overwrite`` argument to ``bzr push`` and ``bzr pull`` no longer
  reports all tags as changed. (Jelmer Vernooij, #845396)

* ``WorkingTree.get_file_mtime`` now raises NoSuchId if a file id is
  specified that is unknown. (Jelmer Vernooij, #847435)

API Changes
***********

* ``Branch.get_revision_delta`` has been deprecated. Use
  ``Repository.get_revision_delta`` instead. (Jelmer Vernooij, #859712)

* Plugins that implement custom protocols for ``bzr serve`` should now
  also take an argument ``timeout``. This is used by the the bzr protocol
  to close a connection if a client has been idle for more than X seconds.
  (Default 5minutes). (John Arbash Meinel)

* ``Repository.fileids_altered_by_revision_ids`` has been moved to
  ``VersionedFileRepository`` and is no longer part of the standard
  ``Repository`` interface. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The argument ``include_merges`` to ``missing.find_unmerged`` has
  been renamed to ``include_merged``. The old name is still supported
  for now but will cause a deprecation warning. (Martin von Gagern)

* The new method ``ControlDirFormat.is_initializable()`` returns a boolean
  indicating whether or not it is possible to use any of the
  initialization methods of that format to create a new control dir.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

* ``Branch`` objects can now use a config stack with the newly introduced
  ``get_config_stack()``. Both ``get_config`` and ``get_config_stack`` can
  be used for the same branch but it's recommended to stick to one for a
  given option.

Testing
*******

* Test scripts can now use ``bzr shelve`` and provide their input as
  complete lines. (Vincent Ladeuil, #856261)

* Really corrupt the pack file without depending on a special length or value.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #807032)

Hi all,

Here comes 2.4.2, our new stable release.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

This is a bugfix release. Most of the bugs dealt with portability
issues. Upgrading is recommended for all users of earlier 2.4 releases.

2.4.2 contains all known bug fixes for all stable releases (including
the ones we made for the previous stable series).

Thanks to all participants sending merge proposals, comments,
suggestions and feedback, we very much appreciate all of them.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.4/2.4.2/ as a source tarball.

Installers are on their way for windows and OSX and will be available
from the url above.

2.4.2 should be uploaded to debian and ubuntu Really Soon Now too.

The detailed changelog is available below,

    Vincent


Improvements
************

* Fixed a bug where ``bzr tags -r x..y`` loaded the branch history once for
  every revision in the range; it's now much faster. (Vincent Ladeuil, #857=
335)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Fixed an infinite loop when creating a repo at the root of the filesystem,
  i.e. "/", due to posixpath.normpath() not collapsing 2 leading slashes in=
to
  one, thus respecting the POSIX standard, but making relpath() loop infini=
tely.
  (Florian Vichot, #861008)

* Fixed loading of external merge tools from config to properly decode
  command-lines which contain embedded quotes. (Gordon Tyler, #828803)

* Include declaration of 'changed' to avoid an UnboundLocalError in dirstate
  pyrex code with new Cython versions. (Denys Duchier, #837221)

* Prevent several kinds of OverflowError and other fallout from failing to =
fit
  stat fields into four bytes in dirstate pack_stat implementations.
  (Martin Packman, #683191 #706957)

* Return early from create_delta_index_from_delta given tiny inputs. This
  avoids raising a spurious MemoryError on certain platforms such as AIX.
  (John Arbash Meinel, #856731)

Documentation
*************

* Corrected documentation for ``bzr serve`` in the Admin Guide.
  (Morten B=F8geskov, Martin Pool, #832576)

API Changes
***********

None.

Internals
*********

No changes.

Testing
*******

* Accept both old and new style testtools output in selftest tests.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, Martin Packman, #815423)

* Fix the race for TestingThreadingTCPServer in
  test_server_crash_while_responding. (Vincent Ladeuil, #869366)

* Really corrupt the pack file without depending on a special length or val=
ue.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #807032)

Hi,

Here comes 2.5b3, our third beta for the 2.5 series.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

2.5.0 is planned to be released in February 2012.

2.5b3 contains all know bug fixes including the ones made for the
previous stable releases.

This release includes log options for ``push`` and ``pull``, more UI
polish for colocated branches, a better and more coherent implementation
for UI dialogs, enhancements to the config framework and more.

Did I mention https://translations.launchpad.net/bzr ?

A warm thank you to all of you sending feedback, suggestions, even merge
proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5b3/ as a source tarball.

Packages have been uploaded for debian and Ubuntu Precise, an installer
is available for OSX, the installer for windows and the packages are on
their way for the usual GNU/Linux distributions that propose our beta
releases as well as the beta PPA for Ubuntu.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None

New Features
************

* The ``log_format`` configuration can be used with ``-Olog_format=3Dline``=
 to
  change the format ``push`` and ``pull`` use to display the
  revisions. I.e.: ``bzr pull -v -Olog_format=3Dshort`` will use the ``shor=
t``
  format instead of the default ``long`` one. (Vincent Ladeuil, #861472)

* The new config scheme allows an alternative syntax for the 'appenpath'
  policy relying on option expansion and defining a new 'relpath' option
  local to a section. Instead of using '<option>:policy=3Dappendpath', the
  option value can de defined as 'option=3Dxxxx/{relpath}'.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #832013)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr info -v`` now shows the number of colocated branches
  for control directories that support them.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #863285)

* ``bzr version-info`` now takes a ``--revision`` argument.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #238705)

* ``bzr revno`` now takes a ``--revision`` argument.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #870649)

* ``bzr serve`` now can serve from URLs rather than just from the
  file system. I.e.: ``bzr serve -d lp:bzr`` or
  ``bzr serve -d file:///data/bzr`` (Jelmer Vernooij)

* all input prompts are now char-based when possible, and can be forced to
  line-based mode by setting the ``BZR_TEXTUI_INPUT`` environment variable
  to 'line-based'. This replace the previous shelf UI only patch using
  ``INSIDE_EMACS``. (Beno=EEt Pierre)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr info`` now shows the master branch location too for
  treeless local branches. (Jelmer Vernooij, #258355)

* ``bzr mkdir --quiet`` now does not print a line for every created
  directory. (Martin von Gagern, #869915)

* ``bzr mv`` does not crash when attempting to move the root of a
  branch. (Jonathan Riddell, #809728)

* ``bzr shelve`` now use ``UIFactory.choose`` for input handling, making
  it usable when creating a custom ``UIFactory`` implementation. (Beno=EEt
  Pierre)

* ``bzr clean-tree`` now use ``UIFactory.get_boolean`` for confirmation
  prompt, making it usable when using a custom ``UIFactory``
  implementation. (Beno=EEt Pierre)

* If sending a crash through Apport fails report the Apport failure to
  bzr.log rather than stderr. (Jonathan Riddell, #766735)

* ``bzr upgrade`` no longer treats 'already up-to-date' exceptions as
  errors. (Beno=EEt Pierre, #716560).

* ``bzr version-info`` no longer populates the clean state for custom
  templates unless {clean} is explicitly asked for.
  (Lawrence Mitchell, #882541)

* Fix finding the CPU count when using Python >=3D 2.6 on BSD-based systems.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #887151)

* ``WorkingTree.clone()`` now supports its ``revision_id`` being set
  to the null revision. (Jelmer Vernooij, #876423)

* ``WorkingTree.pull`` can now pull ``NULL_REVISION``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #887556)

API Changes
***********

* ``Branch.revision_history`` is now deprecated. (Jelmer Vernooij, #799519)

* Methods ``add`` and ``items`` of ``LRUCache`` and ``LRUSizeCache`` are
  deprecated. Use normal dict-style access instead. (Martin Packman)

* New flag ``RepositoryFormat.supports_unreferenced_revisions`` which
  indicates whether revisions can be present in a repository without
  being referenced from e.g. a branch history at the same time.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``UIFactory.choose`` has been added: prompt the user for a list of
  choices. (Beno=EEt Pierre)

Internals
*********

* ``ControlDirFormat`` now has a new method ``supports_transport``
  which format implementations can use whether or not they can access
  a control dir over a particular transport. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``BranchBuilder.build_commit`` now take ``parent_ids`` and
  ``allow_leftmost_as_ghost`` arguments. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Testing
*******

* Ensure TestCase instances are deallocated immediately after running where
  possible. This greatly reduces the peak resource needs of a full test sui=
te
  run. The new ``-Euncollected_cases`` selftest flag will add failures if a=
ny
  case which persists pasts its expected lifetime. (Martin Packman, #613247)

* Report exceptions from child processes during fork instead of swallowing =
the
  error and reporting that everything went okay. (Martin Packman, #804130)

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.

New Features
************

* Provides a ``po_merge`` plugin to automatically merge ``.po`` files with
  ``msgmerge``. See ``bzr help po_merge`` for details.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #884270)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr branch --stacked`` now only makes a single connection to the remote
  server rather than three. (Jelmer Vernooij, #444293)

* ``bzr export --uncommitted`` will export the uncommitted tree.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #555613)

* ``bzr rmbranch`` can now remove colocated branches.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #831464)

* ``bzr status`` no longer shows shelves if files are specified.
  (Francis Devereux)

* ``bzr switch`` now accepts colocated branch names to switch to.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #826814)

* Plugins can now register additional "location aliases".
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Revision specifiers will now only browse as much history as they
  need to, rather than grabbing the whole history unnecessarily in some
  cases. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* When using ``bzr switch`` to switch to a sibling of the current
  branch, the relative branch name should no longer be url-encoded.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Bug Fixes
*********

* A new section local option ``basename`` is available to help support some
  ``bzr-pipeline`` workflows and more generally help mapping local paths to
  remote ones. See ``bzr help configuration`` for more details.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #843211)

* Add HPSS call for looking up revision numbers from revision ids on
  remote repositories. (Jelmer Vernooij, #640253)

* Add HPSS call for retrieving file contents from remote repositories.
  Should improve performance for lightweight checkouts and exports of
  from remote repositories.  (Jelmer Vernooij, #368717, #762330,
  #608640)

* Allow lazy compiled patterns from ``bzrlib.lazy_regex`` to be
  pickled. (Jelmer Vernooij, #893149)

* ``bzr info`` no longer shows empty output if only a control
  directory is present. (Jelmer Vernooij, #159098)

* Cope with missing revision ids being specified to
  ``Repository.gather_stats`` HPSS call. (Jelmer Vernooij, #411290)

* Fix test failures on windows related to locations.conf handling.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #892992)

* Fixed parsing of the timestamp given to ``commit --commit-time``. Now
  prohibits several invalid strings, reads the correct number of seconds,
  and gives a better error message if the time zone offset is not given.
  (Matt Giuca, #892657)

* Give meaningful file/line references when reporting deprecation warnings
  for _CompatabilityThunkFeature based test features.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #897718)

* Make reporting of mistakes involving unversioned files with non-ascii
  filenames work again without 'Unprintable exception' being shown.
  (Martin Packman, #898408)

* Provide names for lazily registered hooks. 
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell, #894609)

* Raise BadIndexKey exception in btree_index when a key is too large, fixing 
  an infinite recursion issue. (Shannon Weyrick, #720853)

* Resolve regression from colocated branch path handling, by ensuring that
  unreserved characters are unquoted in URLs. (Martin Packman, #842223)

* Split segments from URLs for colocated branches without assuming the
  combined form is a valid. (Martin Packman, #842233)

* Support looking up revision numbers by revision id in empty branches.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #535031)

* Support verifying signatures on remote repositories.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #889694)

* Teach the bzr client how to reconnect if we get ``ConnectionReset``
  while making an RPC request. This doesn't handle all possible network
  disconnects, but it should at least handle when the server is asked to
  shutdown gracefully. (John Arbash Meinel, #819604)

* When a remote format is unknown, bzr will now print a single-line error
  message rather than a backtrace. (Jelmer Vernooij, #687226)

API Changes
***********

* ``BzrDir.open_branch`` and ``BranchFormat.open`` now take an optional
  ``possible_transports`` argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New method ``Transport.set_segment_parameter``.  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Repository.verify_revision`` has been renamed to
  ``Repository.verify_revision_signature``. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``RevisionSpec.wants_revision_history`` now defaults to ``False`` and
  is deprecated. The ``revs`` argument of
  ``RevisionInfo.from_revision_id`` is now deprecated. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Tree.get_file_by_path`` is now deprecated. Use ``Tree.get_file`` instead.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #666897)

* Some global options for use with commands have been removed, construct
  an ``Option`` with the name instead. (Martin Packman)

* The unused exception ``HistoryMissing`` has been removed.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

* Add HPSS call for ``Repository.pack``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894461)

* ``bzr config`` uses the new configuration implementation.
  (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Custom HPSS error handlers can now be installed in the smart server client
  using the ``error_translators`` and ``no_context_error_translators``
  registries. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New HPSS calls ``Repository.has_signature_for_revision_id``,
  ``Repository.make_working_trees``, ``BzrDir.destroy_repository``,
  ``BzrDir.has_workingtree``, ``Repository.get_physical_lock_status``,
  ``Branch.get_physical_lock_status``,
  ``Branch.put_config_file``, ``Branch.break_lock``,
  ``BzrDir.destroy_branch``, ``Repository.break_lock``,
  ``VersionedFileRepository.get_serializer_format``,
  ``Repository.all_revision_ids``, ``Repository.start_write_group``,
  ``Repository.commit_write_group``, ``Repository.abort_write_group``
  ``Repository.check_write_group``, ``Repository.iter_revisions``,
  ``Repository.add_signature_revision_text`` and
  ``Repository.get_revision_signature_text``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``RemoteBranch.get_config_stack`` and ``RemoteBzrDir.get_config_stack``
  will now use HPSS calls where possible. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Custom HPSS error handlers can now be installed in the smart server client
  using the ``error_translators`` and ``no_context_error_translators``
  registries. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* The registry of merge types has been moved to ``merge`` from ``option`` but
  ``merge.get_merge_type_registry`` remains as an accessor. (Martin Packman)

Testing
*******

* Avoid failures in test_transform when OS error messages are localised.
  (Martin Packman, #891582)

* Tests are now subject to a time limit: by default 300s, and 120s when
  run from 'make check', controlled by the `selftest.timeout`
  configuration option.  This is currently not supported on Windows.

Hi all,

I'm happy to announce BzrTools 2.5.0

This version is intended to be compatible with the 2.5.x Bazaar
series.  BzrTools is a plugin that provides miscellaneous useful and/or
frivolous functionality for bazaar.

Due to brainfarts, it is referred to as bzr 2.5 in some places.

Changes:
- - Fix compatibility with final beta before bzr 2.5
- - Remove rspush command due to deprecation of Branch.revision_history

I thought this was going to be just another boring version number
update, but there were actually compatibility problems to fix.  What's
more, Branch.revision_history is now deprecated.

It's probably long past time to deprecate it, since it's not efficient
with current branches.  Still, it was used by rspush.

Being so old, rspush was lightly tested, so I don't feel confident
updating it and re-running the tests.  It has no users, as far as I
know.  Removing it seems to make the most sense, but I do feel nostalgic.

rspush was some of the earliest code in bzrtools, and pre-dates the
"push" command.  It was actually named "push" at one point.  At that
time, branches were always standalone, so "pushing" via rsync made
sense.  Nowadays, I don't think it's needed.

For more information on BzrTools, please see
http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrTools

BzrTools 2.5.0 is available at:
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.5/+download/bzrtools-2.5.tar.gz
http://launchpad.net/bzrtools/stable/2.5/+download/bzrtools-2.5.tar.gz.sig

Hi,

This is our fifth (and last) beta for the 2.5 series: 2.5b5

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

2.5.0 is planned to be released in February 2012.

This release includes many improvements in the smart server, UI polish for
the colocated branches, enhancements to the config framework and more
internal uses, bug fixes related to unicode and locale support and more.

All bug fixed in previous series known at the time of this release are
included.

The 2.5 API is now frozen as are the strings for translations.

Since this is our last beta, I'd like to remind packagers and plugin
authors that a special care should be taken to precisely identify which
revisions of which plugins are targeted at the 2.5 series and ensure
that the plugins are compatible with 2.5b5 (and keep paying attention
during the early days of 2.5.0 ;).

A warm thank you to all of you sending feedback, suggestions, even merge
proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5b5/ as a source tarball.

Packages have been uploaded for debian and Ubuntu Precise, an installer
is available for OSX and windows and the packages are on their way for
the usual GNU/Linux distributions that propose our beta releases as well
as the beta PPA for Ubuntu.


External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

* The '.bzr/branch/email' file is no longer read to determine the users'
  identity. Instead, the 'email' setting in '.bzr/branch/branch.conf'
  should be used. (Jelmer Vernooij, #903894)

New Features
************

* "bzr mkdir" now includes -p (--parents) option for recursively adding
  parent directories.
  (Jared Hance, Jelmer Vernooij, #253529)

* ``config.Option`` can now declare ``override_from_env``, a list of
  environment variables which, when set, that takes precedence over values
  defined in configuration files. (Vincent Ladeuil, #907279)

Improvements
************

* New HPSS call for ``Repository.reconcile``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894455)

* Merge now has two new hooks ``pre_merge`` and ``post_merge``
  that are called before and after a merge and can make
  additional modifications to the trees involved.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #906877)

* Override the value returned by ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()`` for the bzr
  script to utf-8 when it would otherwise be ascii on a posix system. This
  will mean bzr works with non-ascii files when no locale or an incorrect
  locale is set. (Martin Packman, #794353)

* ``bzr branches`` now indicates the active colocated branch.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #891667)

* ``bzr push`` now suggests using :parent if there is a parent location
  set. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzr send`` now only opens a single connection, rather than two,
  to the target branch.  (Jelmer Vernooij)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Allow configuration option default value to be a python callable at
  registration. (Vincent Ladeuil, #832064)

* ``bzr config`` will now display the section ``[DEFAULT]`` used in
  ``bazaar.conf``. (Vincent Ladeuil, #907268)

* Configuration stores can now provides a specific quoting mechanism. This
  is required to workaround ``configobj`` conflating quoting and list values
  automatic conversion. (Vincent Ladeuil, #906897)

* Create obsolete_packs directory when repacking if it does not
  exist. (Jonathan Riddell, Jelmer Vernooij, #314314)

* Fallback to the slower ``bzr log`` implementation when displaying a range
  of revisions whose ancestry is not obviously on the same developement
  line. (Vincent Ladeuil, #904744)

* Make lazy imports resilient when resolved concurrently from multiple
  threads. Now the stand-in object will behave as a proxy for the real object
  after the initial access, rather than throwing. Assigning the object to
  multiple names should still be avoided. (Martin von Gagern, #396819)

* Not setting ``gpg_signing_key`` or setting it to ``default`` will use the
  user email (obtained from the ``email`` configuration option or its
  default value). (Vincent Ladeuil, Jelmer Vernooij, #904550)

* Prevent spurious InconsistentDelta error when committing a move of a
  non-ascii directory with contents. (Rory Yorke, #185211)

* Properly ignore '\n' in an option reference since this cannot be part of a
  config option identifier. (Vincent Ladeuil, #902125)

* Make sure that the bzr probers are always registered when
  bzrlib.workingtree is imported. (Jelmer Vernooij, #905218)

* Report mistake trying to move a removed file with a non-ascii name without
  UnicodeEncodeError being raised. (Martin Packman, #898541)

* Safely unquote configuration values in weird edge cases (a section seen as
  a dictionary which is not a supported use case for the configuration
  stacks). (Vincent Ladeuil, #908050)

* Stop altering ``sys.platform`` on OSX when initialising the locale.
  (Martin Packman, #570495)

* Uncommit no longer removes tags if they are part of the working
  trees pending merges. (Jelmer Vernooij, #905462)

API Changes
***********

* ``Config.signature_needed``, ``Config.signing_policy``,
  ``Config.gpg_signing_key``, ``Config.gpg_signing_command``,
  ``Config.checking_policy`` and ``Config.post_commit`` are now deprecated.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``Repository.get_commit_builder`` now takes a ``config_stack``
  rather than a ``config`` argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Scripts using bzrlib should now ensure setlocale is called on posix
  platforms if they need a non-ascii user encoding. (Martin Packman)

* Send formats now accept a new optional argument ``submit_branch``,
  which can be None or a Branch object for the submit branch location.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``VersionedFileRepository.add_revision`` no longer takes a ``config``
  argument. (Jelmer Vernooij)

Internals
*********

* Add HPSS call for ``Branch.get_checkout_format``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894459)

* Add HPSS call for ``Repository.pack``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894461)

* Add HPSS calls for ``Repository.iter_files_bytes``, speeding up
  several commands including ``bzr export`` and ``bzr co --lightweight``.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #608640)

* All bzr control directories, branch formats, repository formats and
  working tree formats now support feature flags, which are
  serialized in their respective format files. See
  ``doc/developers/feature-flags.txt`` for details.
  (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``bzrlib.urlutils`` now includes ``quote`` and ``unquote`` functions,
  rather than importing them from ``urllib``. This prevents loading
  of the ``socket``, ``ssl`` and ``urllib`` modules for
  local bzr operations. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Configuration options can be SI units by using ``int_SI_from_unicode`` as
  their ``convert_from_unicode`` helper. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* Configuration stacks can now use ``StartingPathMatcher`` to select the
  sections matching a location while respecting the order chosen by the user
  in the configuration file: from generic sections to specific
  sections. (Vincent Ladeuil, #832046).

* Configuration stores can now save incremental changes by using
  ``save_changes()`` instead of ``save()``. This reduces the number or
  required input/outputs and allows stores to be shared between
  stacks. (Vincent Ladeuil)

* ControlDir now has a get_branches method that returns a dictionary
  whose keys are the names of the branches and whose values are the
  branches themselves. The active branch uses the key None.
  (Neil Martinsen-Burrell)

* Helper ``osutils.path_from_environ`` added for extracting a unicode path
  from an environment variable. (Martin Packman, #832028)

* Helper ``win32utils.get_environ_unicode`` added for avoiding encoding
  problems with ``os.environ.get`` use. (Martin Packman, #262874) 

* Lazy imports can now only be absolute. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Merge3Mergers now have an optional ``other_branch`` argument
  which contains the branch from which the ``other_tree``
  was obtained, if any. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* MutableTree now has a hook ``post_build_tree`` which is called after
  a new mutable tree has been created. (Jelmer Vernooij, #912765)

* New HPSS call ``BzrDir.checkout_metadir``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894459)

* New HPSS call ``VersionedFileRepository.get_inventories``,
  speeding up various commands including ``bzr export``,
  ``bzr checkout`` and ``bzr cat``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #608640)

* The ``ConfigCommandLineStore`` is now supported by ``bzr config`` and is
  seen as single no-name section of configuration options. (Vincent Ladeuil)

Testing
*******

* New matcher ``ContainsNoVfsCalls`` which filters a list of HPSS
  calls for VFS requests. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* New ``MemoryStack`` class allows for diskless tests and locally injected
  configuration stacks.  Lower level tests for predefined set of options can
  be written without setting up configuration files. (Vincent Ladeuil)

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of
QBzr 0.22.0 codenamed "Alder".

This release intended to be used as companion release for bzr 2.5, and 
might support bzr 2.4.

I'd like to thank the people who have helped make this release awesome. 
Thank you.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
What's new in this release:

QBzr 0.22 is companion release for bzr 2.5, and compatible with bzr 2.4.
This release has many improvements and bugfixes. As usual many 
improvements related to qdiff dialog.

While searching for the word or sentence all matches are highlighted.
This highlighting works in qdiff, qshelve, qunshelve, qannotate.
To make navigation faster through the long side-by-side diff, or inside 
big annotated file you can use backside guide bar in qdiff and qannotate.

Behavior change: "Unchanged" option in treewidget filter now only 
applies to versioned files. (Before it was applied to unknown files too).

Other qdiff improvements include: curved lines are using in side-by-side 
view, smart synchronization of side-by-side view in "Complete" mode;
files with wrong or mixed encoding no more shown as "latin-1", but in 
user-specified encoding.

For full list of improvements and bugfixes please see changelog below.

Hi,

This is the sixth (and last (really)) beta of the 2.5 series: 2.5b6

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

2.5.0 is planned to be released in March 2012.

This introduces the support for colocated branches into the '2a' format in a
backward compatible way, fix more glitches in the colocated UI, verify https
certificates for the urllib https client implementation, fix some more
unicode issues and more.

All bugs fixed in previous series known at the time of this release are
included.

The 2.5 API is now frozen as are the strings for translations.

Since this is our very last beta, I'd like to remind packagers and
plugin authors that a special care should be taken to precisely identify
which revisions of which plugins are targeted at the 2.5 series and
ensure that the plugins are compatible with 2.5b6 (and keep paying
attention during the early days of 2.5.0 ;).

A warm thank you to all of you sending feedback, suggestions, even merge
proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5b6/ as a source tarball.

Packages have been uploaded for debian and Ubuntu precise, installers
for osx and windows should follow shortly.

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.

New Features
************

* Support for colocated branches is now available in the default
  format ("2a"). (Jelmer Vernooij)

Improvements
************

* ``bzr switch -b`` in a standalone tree will now create a colocated branch.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #918197)

* ``bzr info`` now reports when there are present (but unused) colocated
  branches. (Jelmer Vernooij, #891646)

* Checkouts can now be into target directories that already have
  a control directory (but no branch or working tree).
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #913980)

* Colocated branches can now have names including forward slashes, to
  allow for namespaces. (Jelmer Vernooij, #907980)

* New HPSS call for ``BzrDir.get_branches``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #894460)

* Checkouts of colocated branches are now always lightweight.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #918828)

Bug Fixes
*********

* ``bzr branch`` now fetches revisions when branching into an empty
  control directory. (Jelmer Vernooij, #905594)

* A sane default is provided for ``ssl.ca_certs`` which should points to the
  Certificate Authority bundle for supported platforms.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #920455)

* ``bzr branch`` generates correct target branch locations again if not
  specified. (Jelmer Vernooij, #919218)

* ``bzr send`` works on treeless branches again.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #921591)

* ``bzr version`` no longer throws a UnicodeDecodeError if the .bzr.log path
  contains non-ascii characters. (Martin Packman, #312841)

* Support scripts that don't call bzrlib.initialize() but still call run_bzr().
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #917733)

* Test for equality instead of object identity where ROOT_PARENT is concerned.
  (Wouter van Heyst, #881142)

* urllib-based HTTPS client connections now verify the server certificate
  validity as well as the hostname.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, Vincent Ladeuil, #651161)


API Changes
***********

* ``config.config_dir`` and related functions now always return paths as
  unicode. (Martin Packman, #825826)

* ``ControlDir`` now has a new method ``set_branch_reference`` which can
  be used for setting branch references. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* ``ControlDir.destroy_branch`` now raises ``NotBranchError`` rather than
  ``NoSuchFile`` if the branch didn't exist. (Jelmer Vernooij, #921693)

Internals
*********

* A new matcher ``RevisionHistoryMatches`` has been added. (Jelmer Vernooij)

* Add new module ``bzrlib.url_policy_open``. (Jelmer Vernooij, #850843)

* ``MutableTree`` has two new hooks ``pre_transform`` and
  ``post_transform`` that are called for tree transform operations.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #912084)


Testing
*******

* Be more careful about closing open files for pypy interoperability.
  (Wouter van Heyst)

On behalf of Bazaar Explorer developers I'd like to announce another 
maintenance release in 1.2 series: Bazaar Explorer 1.2.2.

It's highly recommended to update your 1.2 version.
Especially for Windows users.

Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application for using the Bazaar version
control system, a modern VCS that supports both centralized and
distributed version control. Our 1.2.2 release runs on GNU/Linux (both
GNOME and KDE), Windows and OS X desktops and is available in many
languages.

Downloads
---------
See page https://launchpad.net/bzr-explorer/1.2/1.2.2 for tarball and
windows installer.

Changes
-------
New features:

* New menu item "Bazaar > Work > Ignore unversioned..." to launch new 
qignore
   dialog (available in QBzr 0.22.1 or later).

Improvements:

* Added support to populate %(wt_selected)s tool action command 
placeholder from
   working tree selected items.

Bug Fixes:

* Use absolute file path when opening with a text editor (Ryan Haigh, 
#836631)
* Fix endless loop on workingtree view filename filter (Jonathan
   Riddell, #822738)
* Fix workingtree view filename filter to match first character
   (Jonathan Riddell)
* Cope with broken history.dat files which can cause explorer to fail to 
start
   with a cryptic error from unpickling otherwise. (Martin Packman, #814151)

Workarounds:

* QFileSystemWatcher disabled for working tree view and for repository view
   while running on Windows due the huge amount of bug reports related 
to it.

On behalf of the Bazaar team and community, I'm happy to announce
availability of a new release of the bzr adaptive version control
system.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5.0 as a source tarball.

Installers are available for windows and OSX from the url above too.

This release marks the start of a new long-term-stable series. From here, we
will only make bugfix releases on the 2.5 series (2.5.1, etc, and support it
until April 2017), while 2.6 will become our new development series.

This is a bugfix and polish release over the 2.4 series, with a large number
of bugs fixed (~170 for the 2.5 series alone). The 2.5 series provides a
faster smart protocol implementation for many operations, basic support for
colocated branches. We have started translating bzr with the 2.5 series:
https://translations.launchpad.net/bzr, more than 20 languages have already
been registered but these are the early days, contributions welcome.

Only a few bugfixes have been included since 2.5b6 so all known fixed bugs
are included here.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.

See
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/whats-new/whats-new-in-2.5.html
for more details,

      Vincent

Hi all, 

New releases are available for bzr-upload:

* for bzr <= 2.4 use the 1.0.1 release tarball at
  https://launchpad.net/bzr-upload/1.0/1.0.1

* for bzr 2.5 use the 1.1.0 release tarball at
  https://launchpad.net/bzr-upload/1.1/1.1.0

These releases are mainly intended to clear up compatibility issues with
various bzr series for the regression tests and define proper branches
to simplify bzr packaging.

The 1.0 series is compatible with bzr up to 2.4 (2.4 is required to run
the tests though).

The 1.1 series is compatible with the 2.5 bzr series.

Both series should only receive bug fixes, new developments will occur
on trunk which is targeted at the upcoming 2.6 bzr series. A 1.2 series
will be created when needed. 

        Vincent

Hi,

I'm pleased to announce the first beta for the 2.6 series: 2.6b1.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of

2.6.0 is planned to be released in August 2012.

This release includes ssl certificates verification from the urllib-based
http implementation turned on by default, fixes some UI issues around
colocated branches, documentation fixes and more.

2.6b1 contains all know bug fixes including the ones made for the
previous stable releases.

A warm thank you to all people that send feedback, suggestions, even
merge proposals making bzr better !

Bazaar is now available for download from

I've released new maintenance release of scmproj 0.6.2. It's compatible 
with bzr 2.5.

Changes:

  * ``project-command`` new checker option ``--not-snapshotted-revision``
    to select only those local components that have tip revisions different
    from the snapshot. (Addressed Bug #678101).
  * ``project-command`` has got explicit ``--dry-run`` option to be 
compatible
    with bzr 2.5.0. (Bug #980852)

Hi all,

Here comes our new stable release: 2.5.1

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

This is a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended for all users on
earlier 2.5 releases.

2.5.1 contains all known bug fixes for all stable releases (including
the ones we made for the previous stable series).

Thanks to all participants, whether you sent merge proposals, comments,
suggestions and feedback, we very much appreciate all of them.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.5/2.5.1/ as a source tarball.

Installers are available for OSX from the url above, windows ones are on
their way.

2.5.1 has also been uploaded to ubuntu.

The detailed changelog is available below,

    Vincent

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

None.

New Features
************

None.

Improvements
************

* ``bzr rmbranch`` now supports removing colocated branches.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #920653)

* ``bzr rmbranch`` no longer removes active branches unless ``--force``
  is specified. (Jelmer Vernooij, #922953)

Bug Fixes
*********

* Connecting with HTTPS via HTTP now correctly uses the host name of the
  destination rather than the proxy when checking certificates.
  (Martin Packman, #944696)

* Fixed merge tool availability checking and invocation to search the
  Windows App Path registry in addition to the PATH. (Gordon Tyler, #939605)

* Fixed problem with getting errors about failing to open /dev/tty when using
  Bazaar Explorer to sign commits. (Mark Grandi, #847388)

* Fix UnicodeEncodeError when translated progress task messages contain
  non-ascii text. (Martin Packman, #966934)

* Make sure configuration options can provide their own help topic.
  (Jelmer Vernooij, #941672)

Documentation
*************

* The alpha-quality texinfo sphinx builder has been deprecated. Sphinx >=
  1.1.2 now provides a better one. Most of the documentation can now be
  generated to the texinfo format with ``make texinfo-sphinx``. This will
  generate both the ``.texi`` files and the ``.info`` ones.
  (Vincent Ladeuil, #940164)

API Changes
***********

None.

Testing
*******

* Add support for pyftpdlib >= 0.7.0 and drop support for previous pyftpdlib
  versions. (Vincent Ladeuil, #956027)

* Run smoketest for setup.py isolated in a tempdir. (Martin Packman, #140874)

On behalf of QBzr development team I'm happy to announce new release of
QBzr 0.23.0 codenamed "Birch".

This release intended to be used as companion release for bzr 2.6, and 
might support bzr 2.5.

I'd like to thank all people who have helped make this release awesome. 
Thank you.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
QBzr 0.23 is companion release for bzr 2.6, and compatible with bzr 2.5.

Behavior change: External diff behavior is changed as below.(IWATA Hidetaka)
  1. When calling external diff for multiple files, all diffs shown at 
once.(Bug #942218)
  2. Working tree or branch is locked only when starting up of diff 
tools.(Bug #942221)
This affects to all commands which use external diff.
(qdiff, qcommit, qbrowse, qannotate, ...)

Now, you can launch 'Shelve' directly from each dialog when uncommitted 
change blocks action.
And you can launch 'Resolve' directly when conflicts generated. (IWATA 
Hidetaka #935903)

New feature of qannotate command: command-line option `--line=N` (`-L`)
allows you to jump right to specific line.
That could be used for tighter integration with editors and IDEs.

Annotation window now uses e-mail of revision author to define background
color of revision. Previously we've used author name to define background
color, so changes in different revisions made by user with the same e-mail
but with differently spelled name was highlighted with different colors.

Simple actions to resolve conflicts: 'take "THIS"' and 'take "OTHER"'.
Available from context menu.

Show simple message box instead of exception report dialog when failing 
to lock. (#935902)

Improvements of qlog's context menus: better context menu of deleted files,
and for files from virtual "Working Tree" revision (available when
qlog run with --show-tree option). Also properly refresh the state of 
changes
in virtual "Working Tree" revision.

For full list of improvements and bugfixes please see changelog below.

      (IWATA Hidetaka, Bug #1021076)

I've finally (lonnnng overdue - sorry!) cut a release of loggerhead 1.18.2.

Its now on pypi, so (in principle) pip/easyinstall installable.

Cheers,
Rob

1.18.2 [12Sep2012]
------------------

    - Add ``bzr load-test-loggerhead`` as a way to make sure loggerhead can
      handle concurrent requests, etc. Scripts can be written that spawn
      multiple threads, and issue concurrent requests.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    - HEAD requests should not return body content. This is done by adding
      another wsgi middleware that strips the body when the REQUEST_METHOD is
      HEAD. Note that you have to add the middleware into your pipeline, and
      it does not decrease the actual work done.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #716201)

    - If we get a HEAD request, there is no reason to expand the template, we
      shouldn't be returning body content anyway.
      (John Arbash Meinel, #716201, #716217)

    - Merge the pqm changes back into trunk, after trunk was reverted to an old
      revision. (John Arbash Meinel, #716152)

    - Redirect ``/files/file.txt`` to ``/view/file.txt`` and ``/view/dir`` to
      ``/files/dir``. (Jasper St. Pierre, #569358)

    - Remove ``start-loggerhead`` and ``stop-loggerhead`` which were already
      deprecated. (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Show "Author(s)" as separate from "Committer". And label them
      correctly. (John Arbash Meinel, #733015)

    - The json module is no longer claimed to be supported as alternative for
      simplejson. (Jelmer Vernooij, #586611)

    - Viewing the ``/changes`` page only iterates enough of the history to show
      the actual revisions displayed, rather than walking the whole mainline.
      Improves performance on projects with long histories like emacs.
      (John Arbash Meinel)

    - Fix support for displaying foreign revision ids.
      (Jelmer Vernooij, #736026)

    - Add hook 'controller' to BranchWSGIApp, allowing other bzr plugins
      to provide custom branch-specific controllers. (Jelmer Vernooij, #585822)

    - Add privacy notification code to loggerhead, allowing branches to be
      marked as private and a notification ribbon to be displayed via
      javascript on the view pages. (JC Sackett, #823471)

    - Add a script and documentation for running under mod_wsgi.
      (Stuart Colville, Toshio Kuratomi)

    - Make tz calculations consistent and use UTC in the UI everywhere we show
      a precise timestamp. (Robert Collins, #594591)

    - Avoid crashing when viewing, annotating or downloading a

On behalf of the Bazaar team and community, I'm happy to announce
availability of a new release of the bzr adaptive version control
system.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.6/2.6.0 as a source tarball.

An Installer is available for OSX from the url above too.

Volunteers are welcome to build a windows one.

This release marks the start of a new long-term-stable series. From here, we
will only make bugfix releases on the 2.6 series (2.6.1, etc), while 2.7
will become our new development series.

This is a bugfix and polish release over the 2.5 series, with a large number
of bugs fixed (~50 for the 2.6 series alone).

All known fixed bugs are included here.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.

See
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/release-notes/bzr-2.6.html
for more details,

    Vincent

Hi,

I wrote a book on Bazaar, which was published very recently:
http://www.packtpub.com/bazaar-version-control/book

The book is intended to help users learn Bazaar, with an undertone of
transitioning from centralized to distributed version control. I
believe this is useful information, that many new, and possibly some
existing users would be interested in.

I took the liberty and added a brief introduction of the book on this wiki page:
http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/BazaarBook

I hope you will find this useful!

Regards,
Janos

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the Bazaar team and community, I'm happy to announce
availability of a new release of the bzr adaptive version control
system.

Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/> is a Canonical project and part of
the GNU project <http://gnu.org/> to produce a free operating system.

Thanks to everyone who contributed patches, suggestions, and feedback.
Special thanks are due Vincent Ladeuil, without whom this release
would not have made it out the door in time to be a part of the next
Ubuntu Long-Term-Support release (16.04), and from whom I have been
learning a great deal.

Bazaar is now available for download from
https://launchpad.net/bzr/2.7/2.7.0 as a source tarball.

There is another source tarball that is nearly identical and equally
valid (signed by the same developer) available on PyPI - the Python
Package Index.[0] We used to point from PyPI to the source tarball on
launchpad, but PyPI[1] now requires us to host any downloads locally.
This requires an additional PKG-INFO file which is now part of our
normal tarball creation process.  Thus, from now on there will be no
need for two tarballs.

Volunteers are welcome to build a windows and an OSX installer.  When
those are created they will be available at the above link.

Bazaar is also available for *BSD through the ports ecosystem at
https://www.freshports.org/devel/bzr/
thanks to Matthew Fuller.

This release marks the start of a new long-term-stable series. From
here, we will only make bugfix releases on the 2.7 series (2.7.1,
etc), while 2.8 will become our new development series.

This is a bugfix release (20 bugs fixed) over the 2.6 series focusing
on test issues triggered by various python 2.7 updates.

All known fixed bugs are included here.

Users are encouraged to upgrade from the other stable series.  bzr 2.7
will be the last series with active python 2.6 testing and support.
Python 2.6 hasn't received any updates since v2.6.9 of 29 Oct 2013.
Python 2.7.9 of 10 Dec 2014 was the oldest version to receive a
security fix with ssl library's match_hostname.

See
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr.dev/en/release-notes/bzr-2.7.html
for more details,

    Richard

Hi all,

I've just prepared maintenance release QBzr 0.23.2. IMO it's better to use
code directly from lp:qbzr, but for packaging purposes it's nice to have
release too, I guess.

Changes:

 * qrun:
   * More robust against unicode help from some hidden commands.
     Attempt to fix bug #1217371. (Alexander Belchenko)
 * qshelve:
   * New command line option --all to start with all changes selected.
     (Sveinung Kvilhaugsvik, Bug #1227914)
   * New command line option --message (-m) to set the message string.
     (Sveinung Kvilhaugsvik, Bug #1233909)
 * qcommit:
   * Better compatibility with bzr 2.6+: fixed warning message
     `Cannot expand "commit_data": Dicts do not support option expansion`.
     (Alexander Belchenko, Bug #1254838)

Tarball is on the page https://launchpad.net/qbzr/0.23/0.23.2

For Windows users I strongly suggest to get copy of plugin by branching it
with command

bzr branch lp:qbzr

into directory with your plugins.

Have a nice day,
Alexander

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

We're pleased to announce the 3.0.0 release of Breezy.

Breezy is a version control system implemented in Python with support
for multiple repository formats including git, and an emphasis on
hackability.

The project is a fork of the dormant Bazaar project, and this release is a
culmination of about a year worth of work since the fork. Key changes
=66rom the last release of Bazaar:

* Compatibility with Python 3 (and Python 2.7 still)
* Support for Git repositories
* Built-in support for extra commands previously provided by plugins,
  most notably: grep, fastimport/fastexport, bisect, upload, stats, heads
* ~100 smaller bug fixes (https://launchpad.net/brz/+milestone/3.0.0)

For a fuller (but still incomplete) list of changes, see our changelog
at https://code.breezy-vcs.org/breezy/trunk/view/head:/doc/en/release-notes=
/brz-3.0.txt.

Installation
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

You can install Breezy 3.0.0:

* From source, by downloading the tarball from https://launchpad.net/brz/3.=
0/3.0.0/+download/breezy-3.0.0.tar.gz (GPG signature at https://launchpad.n=
et/brz/3.0/3.0.0/+download/breezy-3.0.0.tar.gz.asc)
* From pip by running "pip install breezy"
* If you're running Debian, straight from Debian unstable
  (https://packages.debian.org/sid/brz) or testing
  (https://packages.debian.org/testing/brz)
* If you're running Ubuntu, you can install Bionic and Cosmic packages
  from the PPA at https://launchpad.net/~brz/+archive/ubuntu/daily
* If you're running FreeBSD, there is a port (see https://www.freshports.or=
g/devel/brz) available.

Upgrading from Bazaar
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Breezy configuration lives in ``~/.config/breezy``, but it will read
``~/.bazaar`` if the former does not exist. Since the API for Breezy is dif=
ferent
than that of Bazaar, any existing plugins will need to be ported manually.
Plugins you have installed in ``~/.bazaar/plugins`` will almost certainly n=
ot
load.

Breezy has dropped support for the FTP transport.

The command line tool is named ``brz`` rather than ``bzr`` but can be alias=
ed for
compatibility.

Supported plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several of the plugins that were available for Bazaar and that were not mer=
ged into Breezy itself have been ported to work with Breezy.

* breezy-debian (based on bzr-builddeb)
* brz-builder (based on bzr-builder)
* brz-loom (based on bzr-loom)
* loggerhead
* qbrz (based on qbzr)

Feedback
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Please report any bugs on Launchpad (https://bugs.launchpad.net/brz/+filebu=
g).

You can also reach us here on the Bazaar mailing list and on the #bzr IRC c=
hannel on Freenode <https://www.freenode.net/.

Breezy 3.1 alpha 1 has been released. This is the first alpha for the
3.1 series.

For the detailed changelog, see https://code.breezy-vcs.org/breezy/3.1/view=
/head:/doc/en/release-notes/brz-3.1.txt

What's New in Breezy 3.1?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This is the second release series for Breezy since it was forked from Bazaa=
r.
=46rom here on, we will primarily make bugfix releases on the 3.1 series (3=
=2E1.1,
etc) while 3.2 will become our new development series.

Breezy 3.1 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with Bazaar
2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 as well as Breezy 3.0, and can re=
ad
and write repositories generated by all previous versions.


Python 2 EOL'ed
***************

The 3.1 series will be the last Breezy release series that supports Python =
2.7.
Release series 3.2 and later will only support Python 3.5 and later.

New command names
*****************

``brz init-repo`` has been renamed to ``brz init-shared-repo``
to emphasize that it creates
shared repositories rather than just any kind of repository.

``brz sprout`` is now an alias for ``brz branch``.

New Commands
************

A new ``brz land`` command can merge merge proposals
on Launchpad, GitHub or GitLab instances.

The ``brz patch`` command (previously bundled in bzrtools) can apply
patches to a tree.

The ``brz clone`` command can clone an entire local or remote control
directory, rather than just a single branch (as the ``brz branch`` command =
does).

Better detection of other version control systems
*************************************************

Breezy can now detect local Subversion, Fossil and Mercurial
repositories and notify the user about conversion
options.

It will also detect and inform about remote Mercurial, Fossil, CVS-Pserver =
and
Subversion repositories.

Nested Tree Support
*******************

This release improves support for by-reference nested trees in Breezy, both
in the Bazaar and Git formats.

Note that nested tree support is not complete yet, and commands for creating
nested trees are still hidden.

Improved Git support
********************

This release contains a large number of fixes for the Git support
in Breezy, both for crash fixes and performance.

There is also improved support for honoring more of the
standard Git configuration variables in e.g. ~/.gitconfig.

Repositories with Git submodules can now be imported into
Bazaar branches.

Breezy 3.1.0 has been released. This is the first release for the
3.1 series. There are a couple of minor bug fixes since the alpha
release from last month.

For the detailed changelog, see https://code.breezy-vcs.org/breezy/3.1/view=
/head:/doc/en/release-notes/brz-3.1.txt

What's New in Breezy 3.1?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This is the second release series for Breezy since it was forked from Bazaa=
r.
=46rom here on, we will primarily make bugfix releases on the 3.1 series (3=
=2E1.1,
etc) while 3.2 will become our new development series.

Breezy 3.1 is fully compatible both locally and on the network with Bazaar
2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 as well as Breezy 3.0, and can re=
ad
and write repositories generated by all previous versions.

Python 2 EOL'ed
***************

The 3.1 series will be the last Breezy release series that supports Python =
2.7.
Release series 3.2 and later will only support Python 3.5 and later.

New command names
*****************

``brz init-repo`` has been renamed to ``brz init-shared-repo``
to emphasize that it creates
shared repositories rather than just any kind of repository.

``brz sprout`` is now an alias for ``brz branch``.

New Commands
************

A new ``brz land`` command can merge merge proposals
on Launchpad, GitHub or GitLab instances.

The ``brz patch`` command (previously bundled in bzrtools) can apply
patches to a tree.

The ``brz clone`` command can clone an entire local or remote control
directory, rather than just a single branch (as the ``brz branch`` command =
does).

Better detection of other version control systems
*************************************************

Breezy can now detect local Subversion, Fossil and Mercurial
repositories and notify the user about conversion
options.

It will also detect and inform about remote Mercurial, Fossil, CVS-Pserver =
and
Subversion repositories.

Nested Tree Support
*******************

This release improves support for by-reference nested trees in Breezy, both
in the Bazaar and Git formats.

Note that nested tree support is not complete yet, and commands for creating
nested trees are still hidden.

Improved Git support
********************

This release contains a large number of fixes for the Git support
in Breezy, both for crash fixes and performance.

There is also improved support for honoring more of the
standard Git configuration variables in e.g. ~/.gitconfig.

Repositories with Git submodules can now be imported into
Bazaar branches.

We'd like to announce the release of Breezy 3.2.2.

This is mostly a bug fix release. Here is the full list of changes:

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

 * Breezy now relies on an external fastbencode Python module.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

New Features
************

 * Basic support for nested trees in Git repositories, in the form
   of Git submodules. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

Improvements
************

 * Improved parsing of remote Git errors, converting those
   to equivalent Breezy exceptions.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * When yielding hosters in ``breezy.propose``
   avoid accessing the hoster until the user
   needs that. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Pull in new version of ``DirtyTracker`` from lintian-brush,
   adding support for tracking just subpaths of a tree
   as well as several bug fixes. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Add support for finding filesystem types on Windows.
   (Aleksandr Smyshliaev, Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Require that AppData is known on Windows.
   (Aleksandr Smyshliaev, Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

Bug Fixes
*********

 * Several improvements to error handling in the
   gitlab plugin. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Cope with invalid Git submodules when iterating over
   nested trees.  (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Fix pulling of revisions that are ancestors of tip in Git. Previously,
   Breezy would incorrectly raise a DivergedBranches error.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Fix handling of ``git-extra`` revision properties in Git support,
   mostly relevant for hg-git commits with additional properties.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Properly close git repositories when unlocking.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * git: Fix handling of invalid formatted authors field with multiple
   authors. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Fix win32utils on Python 3. (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Fix accidental creation of "ssh:" urls for local paths on Windows.
   (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Let osutils path functions on Windows accept byte strings as well as
   unicode strings. (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Make "make installer" pass on Windows. (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Fix compatibility with newer versions of Dulwich.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

Documentation
*************

 * Updated various references to Windows support, mentioning
   that Windows is currently not supported. See
   https://pad.lv/1951124 for details.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

API Changes
***********

 * Remove ``breezy.osutils.host_os_deferences_symlinks``.
   (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Remove unnecessary ``osutils.open_file``.
   (Aleksandr Smyshliaev)

 * Remove ``breezy.osutils.has_symlinks`` and
   ``breezy.osutils.has_hardlinks`` in favour of
   ``breezy.osutils.supports_hardlinks`` and
   ``breezy.osutils.supports_symlinks``, which
   take a path argument and run filesystem-specific
   results. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Support passing in probers to
   ``ControlDir.open_containing_from_transport``.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Pass along headers in ``UnexpectedHttpStatus``.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Drop support for writing/reading rio to unicode.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

Internals
*********

 * Run flake8 as a separate command. The API is not stable
   enough to invoke it from the testsuite. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Drop unused symbol and token imports.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Support nested trees in Tree.get_file_mtime.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Use same formatting style for versions that distutils uses, silencing a
   warning. (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Drop old and outdated RPM README file.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

Testing
*******

 * test_source: Avoid using the ``parser`` module, which
   has been removed in Python 3.10.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3, #1956500)

 * test_import_tariff: Forbid ctypes during basic operations.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

 * Preserve sys.path when running bzr subprocesses, rather than
   accidentally importing the system Breezy.
   (Jelmer Vernoo=C4=B3)

We'd like to announce the release of Breezy 3.3.1.

This is mostly a bug fix release. Here is the full list of changes:

External Compatibility Breaks
*****************************

.. These may require users to change the way they use Breezy.

* Drop support for Python < 3.7. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Factored gettext support out into setuptools-gettext. (Jelmer Vernoo)

New Features
************

.. New commands, options, etc that users may wish to try out.

* Add ``--open`` argument to ``brz propose``. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* New ``brz web-open`` command, which opens a branch or
  merge proposal in a web browser. Deprecates ``brz lp-open``.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

Improvements
************

.. Improvements to existing commands, especially improved performance
   or memory usage, or better results.

* Various portability fixes for Mac OS X and Windows. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Ship typing hints. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Build binary on GitHub for most Python platforms.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Drop trivial pkg-version dependency. (Ondej Pohoelsk)

* Drop use of unnecessary ``iso8061`` module for Forge interactions.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Support finding GitHub PRs by URL. (Jelmer Vernoo)

Bug Fixes
*********

.. Fixes for situations where brz would previously crash or give incorrect
   or undesirable results.

* Fix compatibility with Python 3.11. (Jelmer Vernoo, #1995814)
  + Remove use of PyUnicode_FromUnicode, gone in Python 3.11.
  + Fix reference counter tests for Python 3.11.

* Handle unexpected HTTP Status errors from Dulwich, converting them
  to the appropriate Breezy exceptions. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Handle out of file descriptor errors in ``breezy.dirty_tracker``.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* git: Properly decode remote tag names rather than leaving them as bytes.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Fix compatibility with Dulwich >= 0.20.50. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Fix ``Tree.get_file_mtime`` in shallow git trees. (Jelmer Vernoo)

Documentation
*************

.. Improved or updated documentation.

* Remove various references to brz-gtk and breezy.
  (Jelmer Vernoo, #1926890, #1837056, #1837053)

API Changes
***********

.. Changes that may require updates in plugins or other code that uses
   breezy.

* Removed ``breezy.revision.ensure_null``, originally added for
  the migation from ``None`` to ``NULL_REVISION``. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* New ``Forge.create_project`` method. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* New ``breezy.forge.get_forge_by_hostname`` function.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* New ``Tree.is_special_filename`` to match on e.g.
  ``.gitattributes`` and ``.bzrignore``. (Jelmer Vernoo)

Internals
*********

.. Major internal changes, unlikely to be visible to users or plugin
   developers, but interesting for brz developers.

* Switch to using Launchpad REST API for lp: URL lookups,
  rather than XML/RPC. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Migrate from pkg_resources to importlib for entrypoints.
  (Jelmer Vernoo)

* New exception ``UnsupportedVcs``. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Support titles for merge proposals. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Use standard python infrastructure to mark extensions as
  optional. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Add pyproject.toml. (Jelmer Vernoo)

Testing
*******

.. Fixes and changes that are only relevant to brz's test framework and
   suite.  This can include new facilities for writing tests, fixes to
   spurious test failures and changes to the way things should be tested.

* Increased timeouts since e.g. the setup test takes longer to run
  now we're compiling rust files. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Raise exception for timed out test rather than killing entire process
  when hitting timeouts. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Add xfail lists for Mac OS X and Windows. (Jelmer Vernoo)

* Properly clear BRZ_SSH in tests. (Jelmer Vernoo)
