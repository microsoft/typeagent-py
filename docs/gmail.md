# Extracting GMail Messages

There's a helper script in the repo under `tools/gmail/`.
It requires setting up and creating a Google API project.
Until we have time to write this up, your best bet is to
ask your favorite search engine or LLM-based chat bot for help.

More TBD.
In the meantime there are some hints in [Demos][def].
