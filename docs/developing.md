# Developing and Contributing

**Always follow the code of conduct, see [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

To contribute, submit issues or PRs to
[our repo](https://github.com/microsoft/typeagent-py).

To develop, for now you're on your own.
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for some things.
Check out the [Makefile](../Makefile) for some recipes.

More TBD.
