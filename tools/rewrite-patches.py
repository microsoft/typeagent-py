"""Rewrite git patches to strip python/ta/ prefix from all paths.

This tool is used to migrate commits from the TypeAgent monorepo to the
standalone python/ta repository. It takes git format-patch output files
and rewrites all path references to remove the python/ta/ prefix.

Usage:
    # Generate patches in the TypeAgent repo
    git format-patch <since>..HEAD --output-directory=/tmp/patches -- python/ta/

    # Rewrite the patches
    python3 tools/rewrite-patches.py /tmp/patches/*.patch

    # Apply in the new repo
    cd /path/to/new-repo
    git am /tmp/patches/*.patch
